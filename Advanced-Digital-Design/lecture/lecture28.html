<h2>Datapath</h2>
You have already seen the datapath.  In this lecture, we will investigate how to 
get this datapath to do all the functions required of the acquireToHdmi component.

Let's spend a few minutes talking about the functionality we want from this
datapath as it will make the organization of the control unit more clear.<br><br>



<h2>Control Word Table</h2>
The control word table (CWT) has a column for each control signal in the datapath
and the external world.  There are a lot of such signals, they are included in the
handout.  You will find an Excel file in the lab assignment which is very useful.

The difficult part of this table is deciding what to do at the Wait For End of Sample Interval.
