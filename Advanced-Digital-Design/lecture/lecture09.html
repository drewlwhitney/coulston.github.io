When reflecting on this lesson, I am reminded of the famous words of 
astronomer Carl Sagan, "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch
you must first invent the universe".  By this I think that something
straight forward like synthesizing a component invokes a whole universe
of topics, all of which are require your understanding.  



<h2>FPGA Fabric</h2>
Up to now you have learned and practiced simulating a digital circuit.  This is an
important first step in the deployment of your digital circuit inside a FPGA, a
processed called synthesis.  The software used must convert your VHDL file into
something that maps onto the internal structure of the FPGA.  <br><br>

The Xilinx FPGA has an array of configurable logic block (CLB) that are 
interconnected by a configurable interconnection network that enables 
signals to travel between CLBs.  Yo could think of the CLBs as small
panels of fabric and the interconnection network as threads that connect
adjacent CLBs.  From this analogy comes the term "FPGA Fabric".
<br><br>

The following figure shows the logical elements that make up one CLB.  
<ul>	<li>purple = 5-input, 2-output look up tables (LUTs). The LUT is
	just random access memory with 5-bits of address, with a 2-bit
	word.
	<li>blue = D flip flops
	<li>green = multiplexers
</ul>

<h3>LUT utilization</h3>
The LUTs are used to store combinational logic, things that can be described
with truth tables.  As an example, let's say you wanted
to synthesize the majority circuit discussed in the first couple lectures
into the FPGA fabric.
The truth table for the majority circuit looks like:

<pre>
a b c | f
------|--
0 0 0 | 0
0 0 1 | 0
0 1 0 | 0
0 1 1 | 1
1 0 0 | 0
1 0 1 | 1
1 1 0 | 1
1 1 1 | 1
</pre><br><Br>

The synthesis software would store the bits 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 in the
first 8 memory locations of the LUT and wire the least significant 3 
address lines to the variables a, b, c.  The most significant 2 address
lines would be hard-wired to "00", so only the lower 8 words would be
accessible.
<br><br>

How can you realize a function with more than 5-inputs?  Use multiple LUTs
and then combine their outputs.  For example, let's say you have a 6-input
function F(a,b,c,d,e,g) that you want to store.  The truth table for this 
function will have 2<sup>6</sup>=64 rows.  Store the first 32 rows in the
A LUT and the last 32 rows in the B LUT.  Send the inputs b,c,d,e,g into the 
address lines of A and B LUTs.  The output from these two LUTs will leave the 
CLB through the AMUX and BMUX outputs.  Configure the interconnection network
to run these two outputs into a third LUT with a, AMUX and BMUX as the 
address bits.  This third LUT acts like a multiplexer with the a input acting
like the select and the AMUX and BMUX values as y1 and y0.  I've put the
truth table below for reference.

<pre>
a AMUX BMUX | F
------------|--
0 0    0    | 0
0 0    1    | 0
0 1    0    | 1
0 1    1    | 1
1 0    0    | 0
1 0    1    | 1
1 1    0    | 0
1 1    1    | 1
</pre><br><Br>

Neat :)


<h3>Pinout</h3>
We are using the Xilinx Zynq 7010 chip.  This ball grid array (BGA) chip has 400 pins.
Like most chips, some pins have dedicated purposes, like power, clocks, and access to
external DDR RAM.   The complete list of pin 

<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/content/dam/xilinx/support/packagefiles/z7packages/xc7z010clg400pkg.txt">Zynq 7010 CLG 400</a>



The pins that you will want to focus on are those labeled "HR" in the
"I/O Type" column. These pins all have labels in the "Pin Name" 
column like "IO_L19N", abbreviated to "N15" in the "Pin" column.
The abbreviation "R17" means that the pin is in row R and column 17
in the following diagram (page 33 in
<a href="https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/19354828041536/ug865-Zynq-7000-Pkg-Pinout.pdf">UG865</a>).

<h3>ALINX AX7010 Schematic</h3>
Let's return to our example of the majority circuit.  Say I asked you to 
connect the a,b,c inputs to three of the push buttons on the ALINX board
shown outlined in red and output the result on the LED
outlined in green.

<br><img src="./img/alinxButtons.bmp"><br><br>

Notice, if you can, the silk screen the names for these button and LED.
<ul>	<li>PLKEY2
	<li>PLKEY3
	<li>PLKEY4
	<li>PLLED4	</ul>

These names appear in the 
<a href="../AX7010 Board Schematic V2.0.pdf ">AX7010 schematic</a>.  I have
found the following step-by-step procedure most effective when using this
complex schematic.
<ul>	<li>Relate your entity to the devices on the AX7010 board
	<li>Look at the AX7010 silk screen and identify the names
		of the devices.
	<li>Open the AX7010 schematic and search for the silk screen names.
	<li>Verify the names match the component that you are looking at
		on the board.
	<li>Look for the silk screen name on Bank 34 or 35 on page 5 of
		the schematic.
	<li>Find the corresponding pin name.
</ul>

For example, let's look for the pin associated with the PLKEY4.

<br><img width=600 src="./img/findPin.bmp"><br><br>

From the images above, you can see that PLKEY4 is connected to 
pin R17.  If you have been following the discussion, we wanted to associate the
c input with PLKEY4 and by association pin R17.  This association between
the c input and pin R17 is captured in the .XDC file.

<h2>XDC file</h2>
We now come to the apple pie.  You will create a Xilinx Design Constraint (XDC)
file that contains the association between the signals of the entity and the 
pins of the FPGA.  For example, the person who designed the ALINX AX7010 board 
made a decision to run the PLKEY4 push buttons to pin R17.  We want that push 
button to be associated with the c input of the majority circuit.  The
remaining associations between the signal of the majority entity and the
pins of the Zynq 7010 FPGA are shown in the following image.

<br><img src="./img/xsaFile.bmp"><br><Br>

This interface between the FPGA pins and entity signals is captured 
in the following XDC file.  Each signal in
the entity has two rows, one defining the pin associated with the 
signal and the second defining the logic type of the signal.

<pre>
set_property PACKAGE_PIN N16 [get_ports a]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports a]

set_property PACKAGE_PIN T17 [get_ports b]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports b]

set_property PACKAGE_PIN R17 [get_ports c]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports c]


set_property PACKAGE_PIN J16 [get_ports f]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports f]
</pre>

A question that might pop-up is, "How to handle signals
that have a STD_LOGIC_VECTOR type"?  All you have to is to
assign each bit in the vector to its own pin and use 
square brackets to index the bits of the vector.  For example
say that we had an entity with 
<font face="courier">data: in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);</font>
You would have the following lines in your XDC file.

<pre>
set_property PACKAGE_PIN U17 [get_ports data[7]]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports data[7]]

...

set_property PACKAGE_PIN T17 [get_ports data[0]]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports data[0]]
</pre>

In this example, the pins U17 and T17 would have to be some hardware
device that was capable of accepting 8-bit values.  We will explore
such devices in later labs.
