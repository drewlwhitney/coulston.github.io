<h2>Testbench</h2>
Before you download your design onto the FPGA, a process called synthesis, you need to 
verify that your design functions properly.  To do this you will simulate your circuit.
This simulation must provide inputs to your circuit.  We will use a structure called a
testbench to accomplish this.  Inside the testbench you will:
<ul>	<li>Create an instance of your circuit, the unit under test (UUT)
	<li>Create an oscillating clock signal
	<li>Control the reset signal
	<li>Control the inputs to your circuit
</ul>
In turn the simulator will allow you to look at selected signal on a timing diagram and,
if needed, allow you to transcend the design hierarchy and look at any signal in your 
design.  To make these ideas more concrete, let's perform a verification of the 
mod10Counter that we were working with last lecture.
<br><br>


The ideas in the previous paragraph are captures in the image of the 
mod10Counter testbench shown below.  T

<br><img src="./img/mod10TestBench.bmp"><br><br>

To simplify the following discussion I will call the mod10Counter_tb component
the testbench.
<ul>	<li>An instance of the mod10Counter is created inside testbench
	<li>The signals inside the testbench which connect to the mod10Counter
	have a "_t" postfix (added to their end).  This "_t" is short hand for
	"testbench".
	<li>The testbench has no external inputs or outputs.  It's entity declaration
	look like:
<pre>
entity mod10Counter_tb is
end entity mod10Counter_tb;
</pre>
	<li>We will have to create a process to manipulate <b>clk_t</b> and another
	process to manipulate <b>enb_t</b> and <b>synch_t</b>.  The code to 
	manipulate <b>reset_t</b> is shown in the diagram.
</ul>

The clock process, named "clk_process" goes through the following steps:
<ol start=3>	<li>assigns clk_t to 0, 
		<li>waits 5ns, 
		<li>assigns clk_t to 1, 
		<li>waits 5ns and then 
		<li>ends.
</ol>
When any VHDL process execution reaches the "end process" statement,
the process immediately returns execution to the begin statement at 
the start of the process.  This forms an  infinite loops which helps 
keep the clock running.
<pre>
1.	clk_process: process
2.	begin
3.		clk_t &lt;= '0';
4.		wait for 5nS;
5.		clk_t &lt;= '1';
6.		wait for 5nS;
7.	end process;
</pre>

The clock generated in this process has a period of 10ns.  Keep this in mind
when you examine the code to generate the <b>enb_t</b> and <b>synch_t</b>
signals in the following test_process.

<pre>
test_process: process
begin
	enb_t <= '1';
	synch_t <= '0';
	wait for 100nS;

	enb_t <= '0';
	synch_t <= '0';
	wait for 10nS;		

        enb_t <= '1';
	synch_t <= '0';		
	wait for 20nS;
		
	enb_t <= '0';
	synch_t <= '0';
	wait for 10nS;		
		
	enb_t <= '0';
	synch_t <= '1';
	wait for 10nS;
		
	enb_t <= '1';
	synch_t <= '0';
	wait;
		
end process;
</pre>

The last statement in the process is <b>wait;</b>.  A wait statement
with no <b>for</b> modifier creates an infinite delay.  This causes the
test cases in the process to run a single time.
<br><br>

The pattern of test signals in this proces may look familiar; it's the same input 
pattern that we used in our last lecture to check that we understood 
the behavior of the mod10Counter.  This timing diagram is shown below.

<br><img src="./img/mod10CounterTimingBlank.png"><br><br>

The reset signal is given in the testbench image above and holds the 
<b>reset_t</b> signal low through a positive edge of the clock and 
raises the reset signal on a negative edge of the clock.

<h3>Simulation</h3>

Its been a long time coming, let's discuss simulating our VHDL code.
There are a lot of tool-specific mouse-clicks, project configurations,
and error message that we could cover here.  But, for the time
being I'll skip most of this and focus on the major steps.<br><br>

After launching the simulator from the tool, you will need to decide
which signals to view on the timing diagram.  You will almost always
put the UUT entity signals on the timing diagram. You will need to
define the color of the signal and the radix.  Both of these make
verification easier.  Later in the semester,
we will use a TCL script to automate this process, but for the first
lab, you will do this manually. <br><br>

The following shows the timing diagram for my mod10Counter.  Does
this output look correct?
<br><img src="./img/mod10CounterTimeSimulation.png"><br><br>

<h2>Libraries</h2>
Up to this point we have used STD_LOGIC_1164 library to define logic values
and logical operators.  To get all this capability, we need to include 
the following two lines at the top of your file.  

<pre>
library IEEE;		
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.all; 
</pre>

Let's look at a few excerpts from the contents of the STD_LOGIC_1164 library.  You 
can see the entire contents at 
<a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/packages/std_logic_1164.vhd">this</a>
link.  
<br><br>

<h3>std_logic_vector</h3>
The datatype that we have been using for our logic values is fully revealed on line
56.  You might have noticed a "U" for the value of currentCount in the previous 
simulation output.  Look at the definition of std_logic below and you will get
an interpretation for this output.  Note that std_ulogic is defined as std_logic
on line 87.

<pre>
line 56:
    TYPE std_ulogic IS ( 'U',  -- Uninitialized
                         'X',  -- Forcing  Unknown
                         '0',  -- Forcing  0
                         '1',  -- Forcing  1
                         'Z',  -- High Impedance   
                         'W',  -- Weak     Unknown
                         'L',  -- Weak     0       
                         'H',  -- Weak     1       
                         '-'   -- Don't care
                       );
</pre>

Note that the std_logic type has 9 different values.  This is the real reason
that your when/else statements should use a final unconditional <b>else</b> 
statement so that every unspecified, weird, combination of the remaining
7 std_logic values is covered.

<h3>Operator Overloading</h3>
Looking at the first hundred lines you will see several different definitions
for the function AND, shown below.  Note, you can get Chrome to show line numbers
by typing Ctrl-u.

<pre>
line 106:	FUNCTION "and"  ( l : std_ulogic; r : std_ulogic ) RETURN UX01;
line 117:	FUNCTION "and"  ( l, r : std_logic_vector  ) RETURN std_logic_vector;
line 118:	FUNCTION "and"  ( l, r : std_ulogic_vector ) RETURN std_ulogic_vector;
</pre>

The AND function is said to be <u>overloaded</u> because there are 
several different functions called AND.  The choice of which AND
function is used depends on the datatype of the arguments to AND.  For 
example, if you write the CSA <font face="courier">c &lt;= a and b</font>.  
and a and b have type std_logic_vector, then the AND defined on line 117
will be used to evaluate the result.
<br><br>


<h3>Truth Tables</h3>
While a bit academic, this library tells us how the AND function (and all
the other logic operators)
works with the 9 different values available to std_logic.  For example
say you are evaluating the CSA <font face="courier">c &lt;= a and b</font>
where a, b, and c are std_logic.  Let a be 'U' and b be '1', what value
will c assume?  Go to the column U and the row 1 to find the answer;
its 'U'.  Note that the table is symmetric about its major diagonal 
because the AND operator has the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property">commutative property</a>.


<pre>
Line 306:
    -- truth table for "and" function
    CONSTANT and_table : stdlogic_table := (
    --      ----------------------------------------------------
    --      |  U    X    0    1    Z    W    L    H    -         |   |  
    --      ----------------------------------------------------
            ( 'U', 'U', '0', 'U', 'U', 'U', '0', 'U', 'U' ),  -- | U |
            ( 'U', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X' ),  -- | X |
            ( '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ),  -- | 0 |
            ( 'U', 'X', '0', '1', 'X', 'X', '0', '1', 'X' ),  -- | 1 |
            ( 'U', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X' ),  -- | Z |
            ( 'U', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X' ),  -- | W |
            ( '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ),  -- | L |
            ( 'U', 'X', '0', '1', 'X', 'X', '0', '1', 'X' ),  -- | H |
            ( 'U', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X', 'X', '0', 'X', 'X' )   -- | - |
    );
</pre>

<h3>std_logic_unsigned</h3>
For all its power, the STD_LOGIC_1164 library does not support numerical
values and numerical operations like addition, and comparisons.  You 
can see examples of these two operations in the 
<a href="./code/genericAdder.vhd">genericAdder.vhd</a> and
<a href="./code/genericComparator.vhd">genericComparator.vhd</a>
basic building blocks.  Open these files and you will see that they
both include 
<font face=courier">use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL;</font>. 
The STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED library supports operations like addition and magnitude
comparisons on STD_LOGIC_VECTORs treated as unsigned binary numbers.  You can
inspect the contents of this library at
<a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/VHDL/packages/std_logic_unsigned.vhd">this</a>
link.  
<br><br>

<h3>Converting integers to STD_LOGIC_VECTORS</h3>
There are times when it will be handy to convert a decimal number into 
a STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.  For example, perhaps you would like to define the
active width of a 1280x720 monitor in your VHDL file.
<br><br>

In order to do this, you will need to include "use IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL;" 
at the top of your file (along with the other includes). This library gives
you access to the "to_unsigned" function given in the code snippet below.
Then inside your VHDL architecture, before the "begin" statement, include
the following code:

<pre>
constant H_ACTIVE : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0) := std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(1280, 12));
</pre>

This line of code is pretty complex, so let's take a moment to look it
over.  The keyword constant does what you'd expect, it makes H_ACTIVE an
12-bit constant in your program.  The right hand side of the ":=" assignment
operator creates the 12-bit value for 1280 using the "to_unsigned" operator
and then converts this into a STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.  
<br><br>

This is a pretty handy code-snippet that you may want to use later on.
