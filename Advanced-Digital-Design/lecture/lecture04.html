<h2>Sequential Elements</h2>
You can't build sophisticated digital device without sequential circuits, circuits
with memory. When a circuit has memory it can do things like count up because in
order to count up to 10, you need to remember what number you are currently at 
in order to count up to the next number in the sequence.  Instead of using the 
word memory, I will use the term, state.  The state of a sequential circuit is 
an arrangement of 0's and 1's that are stored in some basic memory element.
<br><br>

The most basic memory element is the D flip flop. A D flip flop stores a single
bit and output's this stored value, its state, on its Q output.  On the rising edge 
of the clock, the D flip flop stores the bit present on the D input.  The D flip
flop has an active low synchronous reset input.  Whenever this input is at logic
0, the stored value will go to 0 on a rising edge of the clock.  To operate the D 
flip flop as a memory storage device the reset input should be held at logic 1.  
This complex behavior is captured in the following state table.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>clk		<td>reset	<td>D	<td>Q+
<tr><td>0,1,falling	<td>x		<td>x	<td>Q
<tr><td>rising		<td>0		<td>0	<td>0
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>0	<td>0
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>1	<td>1
</table>

A state table is similar to a truth table with the exception of the "+" on the
output Q+.  Q+ means <u>the next value of  Q</u>.  You can think of the current
value of Q as its value just before the rising edge of the clock and Q+ as
the value of Q just after the rising edge of the clock.
<br><br>

The schematic for a D flip flop is shown below.  The clk input has a triangle
on its input meaning that this is a positive edge triggered input.
The circle on the reset input means that this is an active low input.  Now,
try your hand at determining the Q output for the waveform given.

<br><img width=600 src="./img/dFlipFlop.bmp"><br><br>

Finally, let's look at the VHDL code that realizes a D flip flop.  I will
focus on the architecture code assuming that you can produce the entity
description if requested.

<pre>
     process(clk)
     begin 
        if(rising_edge(clk)) then
            if(reset = '0') then 
                Q &lt= '0';
            else 
                Q &lt= D; 
            end if;
        end if;       
    end process; 
</pre>

Some important items to discuss:
<ul>	<li><b>process(clk)</b> will cause the code between
	the begin and end to "run" when the signal in parenthesis
	, clk, changes.  The list of variables in parenthesis is
	called the <u>sensitivity list</u> because the process is
	sensitive to changes in these variables.
	<li><b>rising_edge(clk)</b> The expression "rising_edge"
	is a reserved word and is true when the argument, clk,
	has a rising edge.
	<li><b>if/then/else/end if</b> operates just like it does
	in a normal programming language. 
</ul>

<h2>Mod 10 counter example</h2>
A mod 10 counter counts up from 0 to 9 and then rolls over back to 0
to count up again.  The term “mod” comes from the word modulus.  If you 
take a number x and form “x mod 10” you get the integer remainder after 
division by 10. For example, 12 mod 10 is equal to 2 because 
12/10 = 1 with a remainder of 2.  Note that “x mod 10” will always produce 
a value between 0 and 9.


<h3>Truth Table</h3>
The following state table defines one possible realization of a mod 10 
counter.


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>clk		<td>reset	<td>enb		<td>synch	<td>count	<td>Note
<tr><td>0,1,falling	<td>x		<td>x		<td>x		<td>Q		<td>No clk edge
<tr><td>rising		<td>0		<td>x		<td>x		<td>0		<td>Global reset
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>0		<td>0		<td>Q		<td>Hold
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>1		<td>0		<td>Q+1 mod 10	<td>Count
<tr><td>rising		<td>1		<td>0		<td>1		<td>0		<td>Synch reset
</table>

You will notice that the roll output does not appear in the state table above.  This
is because the roll output does not depend on the clock, it's a combinational
logic circuit.  The truth table for the roll output is given as follows.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>enb	<td>count 	<td>roll
<tr><td>1	<td>count <9	<td>0
<tr><td>1	<td>count ==9	<td>1
</table>

Let's now see if we can apply the ideas encoded in the state and truth tables to
predicting the behavior of this circuit in a timing diagram.

<h3>Timing Diagram</h3>
Let's try to complete the partial timing diagram below.

<br><img src="./img/mod10CounterTimingBlank.png"><br><br>

An important concept to keep in mind is that the output of a sequential device,
the mod10Counter in our case, changes just after the positive edge of the clock.

<ul>	<li>Clock edge at left edge of timing diagram.  Since reset equals 0
	during this positive clock edge, this is a global reset.  This causes 
	count to go to 0.  This value of count causes roll = 0.

	<li>Clock edge between time 0 and 1. reset went back to 1 and now enb
	equal 1 and synch equals 0.  So count goes to 1 just after this
	positive edge.

	<li>Next 8 clock edges. reset is still 1 enb equals 1 and synch equals 0.
	So count counts up from 1 to 9.

	<li>Clock edge between time 9 and 10.  enb equals 0 and synch equals 0,
	the currenCount does not change and stays at 9.  At the beginning of clock
	interval 9, the roll signal would have gone from logic 0 to logic 1 and
	stayed that way until enb went to logic 0.  Since enb equals 0, no 
	roll over is eminent, so the roll output will stay low until enb is
	brought back to logic 1.

	<li>Clock edge between time 10 and 11.  enb equals 1 and synch equals 0,
	so count increments mod 10, causing count to equal 0.

</ul>

I'll leave the rest of the timing diagram as an exercise.  In case you want a 
hint, click 
<a href="./img/mod10CounterTimingSolved.png">here</a> for the solution.

<h3>Circuit Diagram</h3>
After completing the timing diagram, see if you can figure out how to construct
the counter using the arrangement of devices show in the picture below.  
<ul>
<li>You may assume that all these elements are able to handle 4-bit values, just 
make sure to draw a hash through these signals with a "4" next to it.  
<li>You should not draw additional lines in this picture, instead labeled the wires
 with names and use these names to create logical connections between signals with 
the same name.
<li>Draw a border around your circuit.  The only signals that should cross
the boundary are those which are part of the entity description.
</ul>

<h3>VHDL</h3>

As we know, the VHDL description of a circuit consists of two components,
the entity and the architecture.  The entity is pretty simple as it consists
of those signals in the state table description given.  The direction of the 
signals should be straight forward after you look at the architecture 
diagram above.
<br><br>

The architecture requires instantiating an adder, multiplexer, comparator and
register.  Then when/else statement requires from thought to make sure that
you cover all cases and cover them correctly.  The source code for my 
implementation of the mod10Counter is given at the top of this lecture note.
Beyond the logic, which can be tricky, there is one special note that you may
have noticed in the architectural block diagram, currentCount and count.  
		
<b>VHDL does not allow an out STD_LOGIC or STD_LOGIC_VECTOR to be used
as the source value for another assignment statement.</b>  In other words a
signal that is an out STD_LOGIC cannot be on the right hand side of a 
concurrent assignment statement nor used as a value in a coponent instantations
statement.

		
I expect that you will need to spend a few minutes to determine the relationship between the signal 
names in the VHDL code and the architectural diagram above would be well 
spent.
