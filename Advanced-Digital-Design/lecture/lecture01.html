<h2>GOAL</h2>
There are several goals for this course.
<ol>
<li>You will learn to practice digital design.  You should know
how to design complex digital systems.  In this class you will 
learn how to implement such circuits.  
<li>You will gain hands-on experience using a variety of common
devices.  These devices are used by digital designers and many
have been used in your senior design projects.
<li>You will be exposed to some advanced techniques used in
digital design.  If you pursue an advanced degree these are the
topics that you may encounter.
<li>Prepare you for your capstone design project by allowing
you to develop a project idea, plan, and implementation.
</ol>


<h2>VHDL</h2>
VHDL is a language which is used to describe hardware circuits.
You will find that its a logically organized language that naturally
utilizes the concept of hierarchical design; breaking a complex system
into components which themselves are composed of components.  A piece
of hardware is described in VHDL in two separate ways.
<ol>	<li>The <u>ENTITY</u> describes the name of the component and the name and type of
	the inputs and outputs.  In the image below, the entity is named foobar and there are
	3 bits of input a,b,c.  The datatype "std_logic" is synonymous with a bit.  There is
	a single bit of output f.  A component can have more than one bit of output.
	<li>The <u>ARCHITECTURE</u> describes what transformation
	the box performs.  In other words the behavior of the component.  In the image below
	there is a big AND gate which represents the logic inside this component.  The 
	input signal a and b are used as inputs to this AND gate along with two signals
	s1 and s2.  These two bits must have been created somewhere else in the architecture
	and were not shown.  You can think of s1 and s2 as local variables.  One important
	note, you CANNOT use an output of the entity (f in our case), as an input to a
	gate inside the architecture.  If you would want to do that, you would have to make
	a copy of f as a "local variable" and use it as an input.2
</ol>

There are two good reasons to realize a design in VHDL, you can simulate
and synthesize hardware specified.  

<h3>Simulation</h3>
When a design is simulated you have
complete control of time and the values of all the signals (wires) in 
the design.  This greatly aides debugging because the entire design is
transparent.  We will use a program called ModelSim to perform our 
VHDL simulations.  

<h3>Synthesis</h3>
Synthesis means make the VHDL description "real".  Real in the sense
that a logical circuit will have the same I/O and behavior
as the VHDL description.  Synthesis implies that there is
a target piece of hardware to accept the synthesized VHDL description.
In our class we will use the Xilinx Zunq 7010 chip as our target.
This chip contains components (CLBs) which can be reconfigured using
a special file called a bit file.  The Vivado software performs the
translation between VHDL and the Zynq chip.<br><br>

Now that we have some motivation of what we are doing and why, lets
proceed to write some VHDL code.  Rather than go though a long
list of the commands in VHDL (and there are a lot of them), I think
that its easier to look at a simple example.


<h2>Majority circuit</h2>

Digital design is the process of taking an abstract idea for a
digital system and translating it into an actuality.  In order to make
the process more manageable, we successively refine the design in
steps, with each step being a little bit more real than the previous.
Simple digital systems typically have a nice clean design process
as exemplified by the following problem.

<b>Word Statement</b> Build a circuit (SOP min) with 3-bits of 
input and 1-bit of output.  The output equals 1 when a majority 
of the three inputs equal 1.<br><Br>

<b>Truth Table</b>
<pre>
a b c | f
------|--
0 0 0 | 0
0 0 1 | 0
0 1 0 | 0
0 1 1 | 1
1 0 0 | 0
1 0 1 | 1
1 1 0 | 1
1 1 1 | 1
</pre><br><Br>


<b>Kmap</b>
You know what to do..
<br><Br>

<b>Circuit Diagram</b>
This will be very important in your VHDL because essentially
you will write a text description of this circuit.  Notice in
the diagram below that every wire which begins and ends inside
the box is given its own label.  These wires (labeled s1,s2,s3)
are like local variables in a regular programming language.
The inputs (a,b,c) and the output (f) are like the values
that are passed into and out of a function in a programming
language.

<b>VHDL</b><br>
In class we will examine which of the lines below
are reserved words and which are created by us.  


<pre>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Name:&ltYour Name>
-- Date:&ltThe date you stated working on the file>
-- File:&ltThis file's name>
-- HW:	&ltHW# and name>
--
-- Purp:A brief description of what this program does and 
--	the general solution strategy. 
--
-- Doc:	&ltlist the names of the people who you helped>
-- 	&ltlist the names of the people who assisted you>
--
-- Academic Integrity Statement: I certify that, while others may have 
-- assisted me in brain storming, debugging and validating this program, 
-- the program itself is my own work. I understand that submitting code 
-- which is the work of other individuals is a violation of the honor   
-- code.  I also understand that if I knowingly give my original work to 
-- another individual is also a violation of the honor code. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
library IEEE;			-- This line is EXACTLY like #include in C
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;	

entity majority is
        port(	a, b, c:	in std_logic; 
		f:   		out std_logic);
end majority;

architecture structure of majority is
signal	s1, s2, s3: std_logic;	-- wires which begin and end in the component

begin
	s1 <= a and c;		-- These statements are called
	s2 <= c and c;		-- concurrent signal assignments.
	s3 <= a and b;		-- They all happen at the same time
	f <= s1 or s2 or s3;	-- unlike a regular programming lang.
end structure;
</pre><br><Br>


The real "meat and potatoes" of the VHDL description are the four 
lines in the architecture:
<pre>
        s1 <= a and c;
        s2 <= c and c;
        s3 <= a and b;
        f <= s1 or s2 or s3;
</pre>
What separates VHDL from a normal programming language is that these
four lines are executed continuously in parallel.  This implies that
the order of the lines is completely irrelevant, any order of these
four lines would work as well as any other.  In addition each of
these lines is always in execution.  This should make sense from a
hardware perspective; each of the gates in the majority circuit
is continuously examining its inputs and asserting an appropriate
output.


<br><br>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
You can use all the standard logic gates including:
<ul>	<li>AND
	<li>OR
	<li>XOR
	<li>NAND
	<li>NOR
	<li>XNOR
	<li>NOT	</ul>

For the time being the data type std_logic will represent logic 0 and 1.  Please understand, that 
there are other logic values a std_logic signal can have, so don't be surprised if you see
a std_logic signal have a different value.
