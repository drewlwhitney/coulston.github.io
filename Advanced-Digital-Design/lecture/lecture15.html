<h2>Datapath and Control</h2>

The datapath and control design methodology break the design of digital
systems into two components: a datapath and a control unit. The datapath
is responsible for all the data manipulations and the control unit is 
responsible for sequencing the actions of the datapath. The datapath is 
constructed from the basic building blocks.
<br><br>

A digital system built using the datapath and control design approach is
still a digital system whose inputs and outputs can be categorized into
Data input, Data output, Control and Status. The digital system shown 
below consists of two components, a datapath and a control unit.

</figure>

The datapath has the ability to perform a wide variety of data transformations. 
The control unit instructs the datapath which transformation to perform using a set
of signals called the control word. An often overlooked portion of
the control word are signals provided by the external world such as the
acknowledge signal in a two-line handshake. The datapath provides status
information to the control unit.  


<h3>Datapath Architecture and Timing</h3>
A datapath is constructed from combinational and sequential bulding 
block.  In many cases you can use the basic building blocks provided
in the VHDL library used in previous assignments and summarized
in the following table.

<figure>
<img src="./img/basicBuildingBlockList.gif">
<figcaption>The list of all the basic building blocks and 
some of their attributes.

</figure>

In some cases, you will have to build your own building blocks like
the videoSignalGenerator or scopeFace.  Regardless, the datapath 
needs the ability to perform all the actions required of the digital
system.  In dividing the design into a datapath and control, when
constructing the datapath, you should focus solely on the actions 
that need performed and NOT their sequencing. 
<br><br>

Each building block that you include in the datapath will have 
some control bits.  You will concationate all of these control bits
into a vector and make them an input to the datapath.  It will be
the control units job to assert the correct control bits at the
correct time.  To help the control unit accomplish this task, the
control unit will need information in the form of status bits from
the building blocks inside the datapath.  You will concationate all
the status bits into a vector and make them an output of the 
datapath.


<h3>Control Unit Architecture and Timing</h3>
The control unit is a finite state machine (FSM), the most general form of 
sequential circuit, a circuit whose output is a function of the input and 
an internal state.  In terms of the Figure below, the input is the 
X vector, the state is the Q vector and the output, the Z vector.

<br><img src="./img/fsmArchitecture.gif"><br><br>

Each of the signals X, Y,Q,Z is a vector, consisting of zero or more bits.
<ul>	<li>The X signal is the status word input from the datapath
	<li>The Z signal is the control word output to the datapath
	<li>The Q signal is the state of the control unit.  Each bit of Q is
	the output of a D flip flop. Thus, if Q is six bits wide, then the FSM has
	six D flip flops.
	<li>The Y signals are called the memory inputs; they are the
	data inputs to the D flip flops. The combinational logic circuit generating
	the Y signals is called the memory input equations (MIEs). In order to
	improve the readability of circuit diagrams, from now on, the clock signal
	will not be shown. 
<br><br>

In order to define a finite state machine in VHDL, you will need to describe the 
logic to generate the memory inputs Y and the logic to generate the outputs Z. 
We will see how to accomplish this soon.


<h2>FSM Timing</h2>
The events occurring in the FSM are referenced to the clock input of
the D flip flops inside the FSM.  The timing diagram below lists events
(numberd in circles) with respect to the clock signal being applied to
the Figure above.  The following list explains what happens at each of
the points in time in the Figure below with respect to the circuit at the
top of the page.

<dl>
<dt>Event 1</dt>
<dd> Since flip flops sample their
inputs on the positive edge of the clock, this point is the beginning of the
timing analysis.
</dd>

<dt>Event 2</dt>
<dd>The propagation delay of
the flip flops means a small delay occurs between the clock edge and the flip
flop outputs, Q, becoming valid.  This is the called the propagation delay of
the flip flop and denoted T_ff in the diagram below.
</dd>

<dt>Event 3</dt>
<dd>In order to maximize the clocking
frequency of the FSM, the new inputs, X, to the FSM should be applied at
the same moment that the flip flop outputs become valid. 

<dt>Event 4</dt>
<dd>According to Figure above, changing Q and X causes the memory inputs 
to change (the Y signal above). The delay
between the application of the new inputs to the MIE logic and Y becoming valid
is the propagation delay of the combination logic, denoted Tcombo.
</dd>

<dt>Event 5</dt>
When the Y values are valid, a small delay occurs while the flip flops 
register their new inputs, denoted Tsu. After this setup time, the FSM 
is ready for another clock edge.

<h2>Datapath and control - timing</h2>
There are several important reasons to examine the timing behavior of a datapath
and control circuit.  First, so that we can make informed predictions about
the expected clocking frequency of our circuits.  Second, so that we can 
identify critical paths in our circuit.  Third, so that we can develop our
intuition about the operation of these complex circuits.<br><br>

To facilitate a discussion of the timing behavior of the datapath and control
circuit, lets examine the circuit from last lecture, the search algorithm for
a minimum shown below.

<br><img src="./img/detailedDpAndCu.gif"><br><br>

Like we did in our last lecture, we will examine the time its takes, starting from
a positive clock edge, to get the next state setup on the flip flops in the FSM.
The positive clock edge has two
primary effects: It causes the FSM to transition into a new state and it
causes the registers in the datapath to latch new values. The propagation
delay of the flip flops is referred to as Tp(A). Since the datapath
requires a valid control word before it can begin, the critical path includes
the output equation logic.<br><br>

The D flip flops which store the state of the control unit are the
input of the OEs. The delay between the application of a
valid Q to when the OEs assert their new values is referred to as Tp(B).<br><br>

The OEs of the FSM are the control word to the datapath 
telling the elements in the datapath what operation to perform.
Sequential logic components do not actually perform their instructed operations
until the next clock edge arrives. On the other hand, combinational
logic components perform their operations immediately.  It is easy to construct
  datapath instances where the control word effects the status input to
the control unit. For example, the control word selects an input of a mux,
whose output is routed to a comparator, whose status output is sent to the
control unit. Thus, the combinational logic is on the critical path because
its delay constrains the maximum clocking frequency. The time difference
between the application of a valid control word to the datapath and the
status input to the control unit becoming valid is referred to as Tp(C). <br><br>

The status input to the control unit are routed to the MIE logic.
The delay between the status inputs becoming valid and the
MIEs becoming valid is referred to as Tp(D).<br><Br>

Once the memory inputs have stabilized, they must be allowed some
setup time before the next clock edge. The setup time is referred to as Tp(E).<br><br>
