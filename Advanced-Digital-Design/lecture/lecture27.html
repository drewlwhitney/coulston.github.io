<h2>Architecture</h2>
The following is a walk-through of the oscilloscope functionality.

<ul>
<li>The analog input is sampled at a regular interval called the sampling rate.
<li>Each sample is a 16-bit 2's complement number.
<li>The width of the oscilloscope display, in pixels, is called a frame.

<li>Functionality
<ul>
	<li>The oscilloscope is either in FORCED or TRIGGER mode.
	<li>FORCED mode, a button press starts sample acquisition.
	<li>TRIGGER mode, wait for trigger even to start sample acquisition.
</ul>

<li>TRIGGER mode
<ul>
	<li>The trigger voltage is a voltage level.
	<li>If (prevAD7606sample &lt; tigger) and (currAS7606sample &gt; trigger) then TRIGGERED = true
	<li>If (TRIGGERED = true) then store a frame's worth of consectutive samples in the BRAM.
</ul>

<li>Displaying
<ul>
<li>The videoSignalGenerator output the (horz,vert) pixel cordinate that is being displayed.
<li>If BRAM[horz] = vert then paint this pixel the waveform color
<li>As an analogy, this process can be thought of as follows.  Imagine a 3D printer starting at the
top of the display and moving the print head from left to right across the display one row at a time.
When instructed, the printer head dispenses a waveform pixel.  When the printer head gets to the end
of a row, it returns to the left side, one row further down.  In this analogy the position of the 
printer head is given by the videoSignalGenerator component.  The print head "prints" when the
BRAM contains a 2's complement value that is equal to the current vertical position of the head.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Converting Data into Pixels</h2>
You will need to convert the 16-bit 2's complement values from the AD7606 into pixel cordinates.
This is the role of the "2sToPixel" box in the datapath below.  In truth, I did not create
a component for this task, but instead wrote a few lines of VHDL code to complete this task.
<br><br>

The starting point for this conversion is establishing the mapping between the 2's complement 
vtalues coming from the AD7606 and the screen cordinates these points will be plotted at.

<br><img src="./img/sampleToPixels.png"><br><Br>

The waveforms on the display, green trace, consists of 16-bit 2's complement values 
where +5 volts correponds to 2<sup>15</sup> and -5 volts correponds to -2<sup>15</sup>.
On my display, the top is at vertical pixel cordinate 100 and the bottom is at 700 pixels.
The next step is to write a linear equation for the mapping, shown at right in red, between
the 2's complement values and the pixel cordinates.
<pre>
y axis is pixel, denoted pixel
x axis is 16-bit 2's complement values from AD7606, denoted ad7606

So re-interperting y = mx + b, we have pixel = m*ad7606 + b

m = slope = &#x394;y / &#x394;x = -600/2<sup>16</sup>
b = y intercept = 400

So pixel = -600*ad7606/2<sup>16</sup> + 400
</pre>

<h3>Libraries</h3>
You will need the IEEE.NUMERIC library to convert between data types and
perform operations.<Br><br>

There are three major data types that you may want to utilized:
<ul>	<li>STD_LOGIC_VECTOR
	<li>SIGNED
	<li>UNSIGNED
</ul>
All of these are vector types menaing that when you create instances
of them you need to include the 
<font face="courier">(X downto 0)</font> modifier to declare how many
bits the signal requires.
<br><br>

In order to performed signed multiplication (-600 * ad7606) you need 
to convert the ad7606 value into a signed value.  You will accomplish this
using the following syntax.
<font face="courier">ad7606Signed = (SIGNED) ad7606SLV;</font>
The text <font face="courier">(SIGNED)</font> acts to convert the following
objet into a signed type with the same number of bits.  You can do the same using the 
<font face="courier">(STD_LOGIC_VECTOR)</font> to convert a SIGNED type
in to a same length STD_LOGIC_VECTOR.  You can also create SIGNED constants using the 
<font face="courier">TO_SIGNED(-600,16)</font> to convert a SIGNED type

<br><br>

Once you have a signed type, you can perform operations like  multiplication
and bit shifting.  I've included some code snippets below that you may find
helpful. Remeber that multiplying two 16 bit vectors together produces a 
32-bit result.
<pre>
use IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL;

architecture structure of datapath is

    a_SLV: STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(15 downto 0);
    a_SIGNED16, b_SIGNED16, c_SIGNED16: SIGNED(15 downto 0);
    x_SIGNED32, y_SIGNED32 : SIGNED(31 downto 0);

begin

    a_SIGNED16 &lt;= (SIGNED) a_ALV;
    b_SIGNED16 &lt;= TO_SIGNED(-100, 16);
    x_SIGNED32 &lt;= a_SIGNED16 * b_SIGNED16;
    y_SIGNED32 &lt;= SHIFT_RIGHT(x_SIGNED32, 4);

    c_SIGNED16 &lt;= y_SIGNED32(15 downto 0);

end structure;
</pre>
