<h2>Lab 02</h2>
For lab #2 you will use the Vivado tools to write the VHDL code for 
an vgaToHdmiConverter component.  We will use this component later 
to display data captured by a high speed ADC.


<h2>VGA signals</h2>
The video graphics adapter (VGA) standard displays images by sweeping
a beam across the computer screen from left to right in a row.  When the
beam reaches the right side of the screen 


relies on 5 signals
to draw images on a VGA compatiable display:
<ul>	<li>red - a 8-bit value that sets the intensity of red at the
	current pixel location.  The larger the value, the more intense
	the red produced.
	<li>green - a 8-bit value that sets the intensity of green at the
	current pixel location.  The larger the value, the more intense
	the green produced.
	<li>blue - a 8-bit value that sets the intensity of blue at the
	current pixel location.  The larger the value, the more intense
	the blue produced.
	<li>horziontal synch - When the pi
	<li>vertical synch
</ul>

<h2>HD Video Overview</h2>
The HD Video standard is an interface protocol used to transmit 
video data to a screen.  The HD Video protocol uses a scanning method 
to project an image on the screen.  Starting in the top-left of the 
screen, the monitor will progressively move from left to right, top 
to bottom to display each pixel.  The following signals must be sent 
to a HDMI equiped monitor in order to display an image.

<ol>
<li><code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>blue</code> - three 
separate 8-bit signals indicating the amount of each color 
to display in the current pixel.  These signals are sometimes 
abbreviated as RGB.</li>
<li><code>h_sync</code> - Horizontal synchronization signal that tells 
the screen to start writing pixels to the next line</li>
<li><code>v_sync</code> - Vertical synchronization signal that tells 
the screen that the current video frame is completed.  After receiving
a vertical synch signal, the screen then 
starts writing pixels to the top-left of the screen.</li>
</ol>

Both horziontal and vertical orientations contain four unique states: 
<code>front_porch</code>, <code>sync_pulse</code>, 
<code>back_porch</code>, and <code>active_video</code>.   Incoming pixel 
data (through the RGB channels) is only displayed during the active_video 
state of the synchronization signals.<br><br>

The h_cnt value will count up from 0 to 1650 at 74.25MHz. The <code>pixel_clk</code>
carries this clock signal and is generated using the video_clk module.  You should
use the h_cnt counter's value to generate the h_synch and h_active signals using
simple range comparisions.  You can generate the pixelHorz value as h_cnt minus 
the width of the front_porch + synch + back_porch in the active video area.

<strong>Figure 1</strong>: The <code>h_sync</code> signal contains four 
states.  Pixel data is only displayed on the monitor during the 
active_video state.  During all other state, the RGB values must be 
&quot;0&quot;.<br><br>

The v_cnt value will count up from 0 to 750.  The v_cnt value is incremented
every time a row of video is drawn.  So v_cnt counts up much more slowly than
h_cnt.  You should
use the v_cnt counter's value to generate the v_synch and v_active signals using
simple range comparisions.  You can generate the pixelVert value as v_cnt minus 
the width of the front_porch + synch + back_porch in the active video area.

<strong>Figure 2</strong>: The <code>v_sync</code> signal is similar 
to <code>h_sync</code>, but instead of counting based on 
<code>pixel_clk</code>, the states are based on the number of iterations 
of the <code>h_sync</code> signal.  Pixel data is only displayed on the 
monitor during the active_video state.  During all other state, the RGB 
values must be &quot;0&quot;.<br><br>
