<h2>The Stopwatch</h2>
A stopwatch is a device that is used to measure time intervals, usually
 in competitive events.  The stopwatch that you will be designing gets 
its input from two buttons.  The stopwatch will measure down to a 1/10th 
of a second.  The time will be displayed using 3 digits which will represent 
tenths of a second, unit second and tens of seconds.  As a result, the 
stopwatch is limited to measuring intervals of time from 0.1 second to 99.9 seconds.
<br><Br>

The stopwatch’s behavior is dictated by its 2 buttons called S1 and S2
according to the finite state machine shown in Figure 1.

<br><img width=400 src="./img/analogStopWatch.bmp"><br><br>

To make sense out of the FSM shown above, its helpful to imagine
timing a 4-person relay race.  In this race, each athlete runs one lap
and then pass a baton to the next runner.  The time required for a runner
to complete one lap is called their split time.  In order to measure
each runner’s split time, you need to be able to stop the displayed
time while allowing the stopwatch to continue to run its internal 
timer.  This is called a lap feature. Let’s explore how the lap feature
works by timing the mile relay at a Mines track meet. As we go through
this scenario, reference the finite state machine in the figure above.
<br><br>

Prior to the start of the race, you push button S1 putting the stopwatch
into the RESET state.  This clears the internal timer and the displayed
time.  The stopwatch automatically goes back to the STOP state.  You
are ready for the start of the race.  You are ready when the gun goes
off and immediately press button S2 putting the stopwatch into the RUN
state.  The internal timer is keeping track of the elapsed time and
you this the displayed time changing to reflect the internal timer.
As soon as the first runner who is finishing their lap hands the baton
to the second runner, you press button S1 putting the stopwatch into
the LAP RUN state.  This causes the displayed time to stop, showing
the time at the instant you pressed button S1, while simultaneously
allowing the internal timer to keep running.  The internal timer is
now keeping track of the elapsed time since the start of the race.  You
calmly write down the displayed time on your clip board (made easier
because it is not changing) and then press button S1 putting the stopwatch
back into the RUN state.  You repeat this process until the last runner
comes in.  As soon as they do, you press button S2 stopping the internal
timer and showing the time the last runner crossed the finish line.
<br><br>

In this scenario we did not put the stopwatch into the LAP STOP state
– this state would stop the internal timer and keep the displayed time
the moment the S1 button was pressed when the stopwatch was in the RUN
state.  To summarize:

<ul	<li>RESET – Reset the internal and displayed time values.
	<li>STOP – Stop the internal timer and hold the displayed time value.
	<li>RUN – Run the internal timer and update the displayed time.
	<li>LAP RUN – Run the internal timer and hold the displayed time.
	<li>LAP STOP – Stop the internal timer and hold the displayed time.
</ul>

<h2>The Stopwatch State Diagram</h2>

<img width=300 src="./img/stopWatchStateDiagram.jpg"><br><br>

The arcs between states are labeled with a Boolean condition, which when
true, causes the FSM to make that transition. So for example, if the
FSM is in the RUN state and the S2 button is pressed (buttons output
0 when pressed hence the arc labeled S2’), the FSM will transition to
the R2S state (and stay there as long as the button is held down).  When
a number “2” appears in the middle of a state name, the number denotes
the word “to” which is intended to mean moving from one state to another.
The abbreviated names of the source/destination states are written
on left/right side of the number “2” respectively.  So for example,
the state R2S stands for Run to Stop.

These intermediate states are needed because the action of a user pressing
a button takes a long time from the perspective of the 50MHz clock on
the ALINX board.  For example, consider the incorrectly designed FSM shown
in Figure 4.  The intention of this design is to have the FSM transition
from the STOP state to the RUN state when the user pressed the button
S2 (remember that when S2 is pressed it outputs a logic 0, hence the
arc labeled S2’).  What actually happens is that the FSM rapidly toggles
between the STOP and RUN states at 50MHz while the S2 button is held
down.  When the user releases the S2 button there is a 50/50 chance
that the FSM will end-up in the STOP or RUN state.

<h2>Stopwatch VHDL code for next state</h2>

The following discussion will cover the control unit VHDL file
in sections.  The complete code is given at the top of this 
lecture notes.<br><br>


<h3>Control Unit Entity</h3>
The entity is pretty straightforward and given in the following
code snipped.

<pre>
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use work.stopWatch_package.all;

entity stopWatch_fsm is
    PORT (  clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
            resetn : in  STD_LOGIC;
            sw: in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(SW_VECTOR_LENGTH - 1 downto 0);
            cw: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (CW_VECTOR_LENGTH - 1 downto 0));
end stopWatch_fsm;
</pre>

Some points to observe:
<ul>	<li>The package file contains constants SW_VECTOR_LENGTH
	and CW_VECTOR_LENGTH.  When developing a sophisticated
	digital circuit you will almost always need to add and
	remove bits from the control and status word.  These two
	constants allow you to update every occurrence of these 
	values in one place, the package file.
	<li>We will use an active low reset to make the control
	unit consistent with the reset of the devices we are 
	using.
</ul>


<h3>Control Unit Signals</h3>
In order to make the logic of the FSM more readable, we need to create
an enumerated datatype that has the names of the states as the values of
the datatype.  This declaration is in the package and shown at the top
of the following code snippet.

<pre>
--The following declaration is from the package file
type state_type is (	RESET_STATE, S2RESET_STATE, STOP_STATE, S2R_STATE, RUN_STATE, R2LR_STATE,
                        R2S_STATE, INC_STATE, LAPINC_STATE, LAPRUN_STATE, LR2R_STATE,
			LR2LS_STATE, LAPSTOP_STATE, LS2R_STATE, LS2LR_STATE);

-- The following is from the stopwatch_fsm.vhdl file

architecture Behavioral of stopWatch_fsm is

    signal tenth, S1, S2: STD_LOGIC;
    signal state: state_type;
    
begin
    tenth &lt;= sw(0);
    S1 &lt;= sw(1);
    S2 &lt;= sw(2);
</pre>

Some points to observe:
<ul>	<li>The signal state has type state_type and as a result can
	only have the values given in the state_type declaration given
	above.
	<li>The first three lines inside the architecture break-out the
	bits of the status word into a more human friendly format.
</ul>


<h3>Control Unit Next State</h3>
Each state in the FSM diagram shown at the top of this lecture note will 
have a case statement.  Inside that case statement you will describe two
characteristics of each arc LEAVING that state:
<ul>	<li>The conditions on the arc
	<li>The state pointed to by the arc.
</ul>

Let's try this out by examining the RUN state from the state diagram above.
In the following image, I've taken the liberty of trimming out all the
irrelevant states and transitions leaving only the run state and the four
transition arcs leaving the RUN state.

<br><img src="./img/runState.bmp"><br><br>

Now let's work through the logic to describe how you can leave the RUN 
state using an if/then structure.
<pre>
    if (state = RUN) then
	if (tenth = '1') then state = INC 
	elsif (S2 = '0') then state = R2S
	elsif (S1 = '0') then state = R2LR
	else state = RUN
    endif
</pre>

You should note that the conditional express in each if/elsif statement
is the condition on the arc leaving the RUN statement.  Also the then
clause assigns the state variable the identity of the destination state
of the transition arc.
<br><br>

In VHDL that follows the final else statement isn't needed because we will 
use a single state variable.  Also when you have a single statement inside 
an if clause you do not need a being/end if combination; this is much like 
not needing the { or } brackets in C when you have a single statement in a 
if/then body.  Finally, we will use a case/when statement to select the
state that we are currently in and then use the if/elsif logic to describe
the transition arcs leaving that state.

<pre>

    state_proces: process(clk)  
    begin
	if (rising_edge(clk)) then
	    if (resetn = '0') then 
		state &lt;= RESET_STATE;
	    else 
		case state is

		    when RESET_STATE =&gt;
			state &lt;= STOP_STATE;

		    when STOP_STATE =&gt;
			if ( S1 = '0') then 
			    state &lt;= S2RESET_STATE;
			elsif ( S2 = '0') then
			    state &lt;= S2R_STATE;							
			end if;

			....

		    when RUN_STATE =&gt;
			if (tenth = '1') then
			    state &lt;= INC_STATE;
			elsif (S1 = '0') then
			    state &lt;= R2LR_STATE;
			elsif (S2 = '0') then							
			    state &lt;= R2S_STATE;							
			end if;

			...

		end case;
	    end if;
	end if;
    end process;
</pre>



<h3>Control Unit Output</h3>
We will examine the output logic given in the code snippet below
with little understanding of how the cw values are assigned.  This
will be the topic of discussion for the next lecture when we examine
the datapath.
<br><br>

The output_process described below just assigns the control word
a value depending on what state the FSM is in.  This is 100% consistent
with the control unit architecture given in the previous lecture note,
where Z, the output, was a function of Q, the current state.

<pre>
    output_process: process (state)
    begin
	case state is		      
	    when RESET_STATE    =&gt; cw &lt;= "001011";	 
	    when S2RESET_STATE  =&gt; cw &lt;= "000000";            
	    when STOP_STATE     =&gt; cw &lt;= "000000";
		....
                      
	end case;
    end process;	
</pre>

In your next lecture we will examine how the control word relates
to the datapath, and in doing so, create a language that allows
us to communicate to the datapath.  Neat stuff.
