<h2>Lab 01</h2>
For lab #1 you will use the Vivado tools to write the VHDL code for an enhancedPwm
component.  We will use this component later as a peripheral to one of the Arm 
Cortex's inside the Zynq chip.

<h2>enhancedPwm</h2>
The enhancedPwm component generates a PWM waveform with a period of 256 clocks and
a duty cycle that ranges from 0 to 256.
<ul>
<li>When the duty cycle is 0, the PWM waveform spends 100% of its time at logic 0.
<li>When the duty cycle is 256, the PWM waveform spends 100% of its time at logic 1. 
</ul>

At its core, the enhancedPwm component has an internal 8-bit counter that counts up
from 0 to 255 and then rolls over.  This counter's output is compared to the dutyCycle.
The greater than output of the comparator is the output of the enhancedPwm component
with dutyCycle as the x input and the 8-bit counter as the y input.  This means that
when:
<ul>	<li>dutyCycle &gt; counter pwmSignal equals 1
	<li>dutyCycle &le; counter pwmSignal equals 0
</ul>

Try using this logic to draw pwmSignal for the following set of dutyCycle.

<br><img src="./img/pwmWaveform.bmp"><br><br>

You can see than answer <a href="./img/pwmWaveformSolved.bmp">here</a>.  It should 
be clear from this work that in order to have both a 0% and 100% duty cycle, the
dutyCycle input needs to range from 0 to 256, a 9-bit variable.

<h3>Libraries</h3>
When putting together all the files for your project, you should unzip 
the basicBuildingVhdl file  and put it at the same level as your lab01
folder.  Then include the entire directory in your lab01 project.  This
way you will be able to use any of the devices as needed.  In addition 
to the component VHDL files, there is a special file called
"basicBuildingBlocks_package.vhd" which contains the entity descriptions
of the components in the basicBuilding directory.  You will then need
to include the package file as a library at the top of your program as
follows.

<pre>
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use work.basicBuildingBlocks_package.all;
</pre>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
The design of Lab 1 is broken down into separate modules, some of which
are provided for you and some which you will need to create. The interconnection 
of the modules is illustrated in the following schematic. When a signal name 
appears just inside a box, that should should correspond to the name of that 
signal in the entity description.

<h4>genericCounter and generiComparator</h4>
The genericCounter and genericComparator at the top of the diagram are the core
of the pwm generator.  The 9-bit genericComparator needs to pad the 8-bit
counter output with a most significant '0'.  I did this in my VHDL file using the
following CSA.
<pre>
pwmCount9bit_int &lt;=  '0' & pwmCount_int;
</pre>
The output of the counter is called <b>pwmCount_int</b>
because this counter is used <i>internal</i> to the architecture and is an
input to other components.  A copy of this signal is made to
<b>pwmCount</b> and sent out of the entity.

<h4>bottom genericComparator</h4>
The bottom genericComparator lets the circuit know when the 8-bit counter
is rolling over by asserting the E255 signal when the 8-bit counter is equal
to 255.

<h4>genericRegister</h4>
The roll of the generic register is to latch the incoming dutyCycle when the 
8-bit genericCounter rolls over.  Updating the dutyCycle while the 8-bit 
counter was midway through counting to 255 could produce some unusual 
pwmSignal output. The output of the register is called <b>dutyCycle_int</b>
because it's used internally to the architecture.

<h4>when/else</h4>
The when else statement takes the external enb signal and the E255 signals
and determines what 2-bit control signal to send to the genericCounter.
The following table describes that relationship between the 2-bit control
of the genericCounter and the counter's behavior.  This table is contained
in the genericCounter.vhd file.

<pre>
--  00  Hold
--  01  load
--  10  inc
--  11  reset
</pre>

<h3>Hazards</h3>
The greater than output of the 9-bit genericComparator, <b>dutyGreaterCnt</b>
is run through a D flip flop before being sent out as the pwmSignal.  Why?
<br><br>

Large comparators work from the most to least significant bits, each pair
of corresponding bits of the inputs are processed by a small chunk of hardware
called a bit-slice.  The bit slices are connected to one another from most to 
least significant bit.  At each bit slice, looks at the inputs from the more
significant slice, it this more significant slice has determines that X > Y
or that Y>X then this slice just echos this on its outputs to the less 
significant slice.  However, if the more significant slice states that X=Y
up to this slice, then the bit slice comparator looks at its 1-bit x and y
inputs to see if they are different.
<br><br>

During this journey from most to least significant bit, intermediate, unstable 
configurations in the logic joining the comparator slices can develop leading
to transients on the G, L or E outputs.  These transients are short-lived, lasting
nanoseconds, before the comparator output returns to the correct output values.
As a consequence of this behavior, the comparator outputs are said to contain
glitches.  
<br><br>

The following oscilloscope capture shows a pair of comparators, instantiated 
on a Xilinx FPGA, glitching on their outputs.

<br><img src="./img/glitch.gif"><br><br>

The point of all this discussion is that you cannot trust the output of a 
comparator to be stable, it may contain glitches.  The solution to this 
problem is to buffer the output of a comparator with a D flip flop.  Since
the glitches are transient, they will not last an entire clock cycle.
So if we allow the comparator inputs to change at the beginning of a clock
cycle, the glitches will be over before the arrival of the next clock
edge.  This is the reason that we buffer the output of the comparator
with a D flip flop.
