<h2>Zynq</h2>
The Zynq 7010 chip is separated into 2 halves, a processing system and
a programmable logic section.  Up to this point, we have been working
exclusively with the programmable logic section through Vivado.  It's
now time to turn our attention to the processing system.<Br>

The processing system contains a pair of ARM Cortex-A9 CPUs. Some
important facts about the Arm-A9:
<ul>
<li>I sometimes refer to the ARM Cortex-A9 as the "Zynq
	processor" in my written documents.
<li>It has a 32-bit word.  This means that all operations are performed
	in 32-bits units.  This includes reading and writing memory and
	arithmetic and logic operations.
<li>It is byte addressable.  This means that that every increment in 
	address moves forward 8-bit.  
<li>Has a built in USART that will allow us to communicate with our
	programs using PuTTy.
</ul>

One special feature that we will focus on is that the Arm-A9 can
communicate with the programmable logic through the AXI interface.  

<br><img width=500 src="./img/zynq-mp-core-dual.png"><br><br>

The AXI interface provides you with a memory mapped interface to 
any signal that you provide as part of your IP entity description.
This means, for example, that you could set the oscilloscope 
trigger voltage by writing a 16-bit 2's complement value to address 
0x43C00000. You could read ch1Data16bitSLV by reading from address
0x43C00004.  While doing this you can still send signals directly
from oscilloscope outside the chip.  For example, the HDMI signals
do not need to go through the AXI interface to reach the correct
Zynq pins.  
<br>


The AXI interface will consume a lot of our attention when converting
out IP into a form that can interface with the Arm A9.  

<h2>Enhanced PWM module</h2>
In order to motivate our discussion of the AXI interface and how we 
can use it to communicate with IP, we will build an AXI interface
to the enhancedPwm module.<br><Br>

The enhancedPwm module is virtually identical to that you built 
back in the first lab.  I included a rollOver 

<pre>
entity enhancedPwm is
    PORT ( clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
           resetn : in  STD_LOGIC;
           enb: in STD_LOGIC;
           dutyCycle: in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(8 downto 0);
           pwmCount: out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
           rollOver: out STD_LOGIC;
           pwmSignal: out STD_LOGIC);		   
end enhancedPwm;
</pre>

The addition of the rollOver just signals when the internal counter 
rolls over from 256 to 0 by pulsing high.  You can see the behavior
in this timing diagram.  Yes, the rollOver signal is an external 
version of the counterEqualPeriod status signal.

<br><img src="./img/enhancedPwmTiming.PNG"><br><Br>

<h2>Interfacing your IP with the AXI interface</h2>
Each of the signals on the entity interface for the enhancedPwm
has the following direction and destination.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Signal		<td>Direction	<td>Destination	<td>Note

<tr><td>clk		<td>input	<td>S_AXI_ACLK
	<td>The S_AXI_ACLK signal is part of the default AXI interface
<tr><td>resetn		<td>input	<td>S_AXI_ARESETN
	<td>The S_AXI_ACLK signal is part of the default AXI interface
<tr><td>enb		<td>input	<td>PLKEY4
	<td>Programmable logic can only conncet the the "PL" keys, never the "PS" keys.
<tr><td>dutyCycle	<td>input	<td>Arm memory at address 0x43C00000
	<td>This will allow you to write the dutyCycle in your code
<tr><td>pwmCount	<td>output	<td>Arm memory at address 0x43C00004
	<td>This will allow you to read the pwmCount in your code
<tr><td>rollOver	<td>output	<td>Arm Interrupt
	<td>We can have an ISR that runs every time the counter rolls over from 256 to 0
<tr><td>pwmSignal	<td>output	<td>J11 header pin 3
	<td>You could connect this header pin to a LPF and have a rough DAC.
</table>

Let's look at how this will be accomplished.  In Viado you will use the
Create and Package New IP wizard to describe:
<ul>	<li>Name of the IP. enhancedPwm in our example.
	<li>Number of words of memory dedicated to the IP memory-mapped interface.  4 in our example.
</ul>

The wizard will create two files
<ul>	<li>enhancedPwm_ip_v_0.vhd  This file will interface with the AXI bus.
	<li>enhancedPwm_ip_v_0_S00_AXI.vhd  This file will interface with our IP.
</ul>

The files are arranged as follows.

<br><img src="./img/enhancedPwmWrapper.PNG"><br><br>

To make this happen you will have to edit the enhancedPwm_ip_v_0.vhd and 
enhancedPwm_ip_v_0_S00_AXI.vhd  files.  The instructions are given in one
of the "How To" documents.

<h3>Block diagram</h3>
When you complete wrapping your IP in the AXI interface, your IP will be
available as an IP block like that shown in the following diagram.
<br><img src="./img/enhancedPwmBlock.PNG"><Br><br>

You will then connect your IP block to the Arm-A9 using the block diagram
tool.

<br><img src="./img/armWithEnhancedPwmBlock.PNG"><Br><br>

A few details remain like connecting the enb_ext_0 and pwmSignal_ext_0 signals
to Zynq pins using an XDC file.  After this, you will synthesize the design and
generate a bitstream.  The result will be a file that you can import into 
Vitis where you can program the Arm-A9.
