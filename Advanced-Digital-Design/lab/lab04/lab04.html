<h1>Oscilloscope Datapath and Control</h1>

You are going to create a simple but stand-along oscilloscope in this lab.  You will use
the AD7606 to acquire the data and the HDMI port to display the data.  It will be a 
challenge but something to be proud of when complete.
<br><br>

Your oscilloscope will operate in two modes, FORCED and TRIGGERED.  
<ul>
	<li>In FORCED mode the oscilloscope will wait for the user to signal that they want 
	the scope to collect data by pressing a button.  The oscilloscope will then fill its 
	BRAMs with sampled data from the AD7606.  
	<li>In TRIGGER mode, the oscilloscope will wait for the input waveform on channel 1
	to increase through 0V.  When this happens, the oscilloscope will start filling its
	BRAMS with sampled data from the AD7606.  After fillings the BRAMs, the oscilloscope
	will then go back to look for another trigger.
</ul>
	 
When complete, your output should look something like the following:
<br><img src="./img/pics/finalResult.jpg"><br><Br>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
The <a href="./img/signalAcquire.pdf">signalAcquire Top Level</a> consists of two modules,
a datapath and a control.  The user will control the signalAcquire module using two buttons
as follows:
<ul>	<li>Pressing PL KEY3 should toggle the oscilloscope between FORCED and TRIGGER mode.
	<li>Pressing PL KEY4 when the oscilloscope is in FORCED mode will cause the 
	oscilloscope to trigger and fill its channel 1 and 2 BRAMs.
</ul>

For testing purposes you will be sending some of the signals to the LEDs so that you
can probe them with an oscilloscope to measure the performance of your circuit. The
following table lists the names of the signals out of the top-level signalAcquire entity 
and the LEDs they should be sent to.
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>LED	<td>signalAcquire PORT name
<tr><td>PL LED1	<td>triggerCh1
<tr><td>PL LED2	<td>triggerCh2
<tr><td>PL LED3	<td>conversionPlusReadoutTime
<tr><td>PL LED4	<td>sampleTimerRollover
</table>


<h2>Control Unit</h2>
The control unit is an variation of the one that you created in the previous
lab.  You will only be reading 2 of the 8 channels.  The control unit waits
for an event to start filling the memory.  That event is either a forced
trigger, via a button press, or for the input waveform to pass through the
trigger voltage (on a positive edge).  This behavior is encoded in the 
following state diagram.
<br><img src="../../lecture/img/acquireToHdmi_control.PNG"><br><br>


The control word will start to get really long.  I put together the following
excel file to help me organize the bits and generate the VHDL code for the 
output process.
<a href="./controlWord.xlsx">controlWord.xlsx</a>	
<br><br>

In order to acquire samples from the AD7606 and fill up the BRAM, the control
unit cycles around a loop starting at BEGIN_CONVERSION and ending in 
WAIT_FOR_END_OF_SAMPLE_INTERVAL. Clearly the time required to convert and 
read the AD7606 data must be shorter than the sampling interval.  In order
to check this you will add two special signals to the control word,
conversionPlusReadoutTime and sampleTimerRollover.
<br><Br>
These two signals will provide you with the AD7606 conversions
duration (conversionPlusReadoutTime) and the sample interval duration 
(sampleTimerRollover).  You will do this by sending these two signal out of the signalAcquire
module to LEDs and then probing these LEDs with an oscilloscope.  You will then look
at the oscilloscope display and measure these intervals.  In order to get accurate 
measurements, you should hold the conversionPlusReadoutTime high in BEGIN_CONVERSION
through READ_CH2_HIGH and then drop the signal low in WAIT_FOR_END_OF_SAMPLE_INTERVAL.
To get the most accurate value for sampleTimerRollover, keep it low in every state
except BEGIN_CONVERSION.
<br><br>
The SAMPLING_RATE_SELECT multiplexer was included in the control word to allow
the option of increasing or decreaseing the sampling rate.  For this lab we will
not utilize this capability and instead set it to "00" (highest rate) in all of the
states.


<h2>Datapath</h2>
The datapath contains all the modules that you developed in labs 1 and 2.  In addition,
you will need:
<ul>	<li>A pair of BRAMs to store the AD7606 samples from channels 1 and 2.
	<li>Logic to read the BRAM values and compare it against the current pixel position.
	<li>Registers and comparators to look for a trigger on channels 1 and 2.
	<li>Sampling rate counters to set the sampling rate period to one of four
	preset rates.  
	<ul>	<li>LOWEST_RATE	= 2400 counts
		<li>LOW_RATE = 1200 counts
		<li>HIGH_RATE = 600 counts
		<li>HIGHEST_RATE = 300 counts
	</ul>
	<li>A SR flip flop to indicate if the oscilloscope is in looking storing samples
	(only when the oscilloscope is in TRIGGER mode).
</ul>
The complete datapath diagram is shown below.

<h3>The video_clk module</h3>
You will need to generate an IP core for this module usin the instructions
in the "howTo 05 Instantiate Clock and HDMI IP" document posted on the
main web page.

<h3>The hdmi_tx_0 module</h3>
You will need to generate an IP core for this module using the instructions
in the "howTo 05 Instantiate Clock and HDMI IP" document posted on the
main web page.  Do not use the <font color="green">Clocking Wizard</font> 
instctions on the Real Digital web page.

<h3>BRAM</h3>
Start your instantiation of the BRAMs by clicking on the IP Catalog link in the
project manager sub-window.  Enter BRAM in the search text box. Double click on
the Block Memory Generator selection.  Then use the configuration given in the 
following images to create the BRAM. Note, PORTA depth needs to be large enough
to accommodate the width of the active region of your display.  My display was 
1000 pixels wide, so I gave the BRAMs 1024 storage locations. Yup that was 24 
more than needed for no good reason.  This gave me a 10-bit address for the BRAM.
Some of your oscilloscopes have more than 1024 pixels in the active display region,
so will have 11-bit addresses for the BRAM.  Plen accordingly.

<h2>VHDL Code</h2>

<ul>	<li>basicBuildingBlocks_package.vhd<br>
	You will provide this package based on your previous lab work.

	<li><a href="./code/an7606.vhd">an7606.vhd</a><br>
	This is an improved version of the an7606 module.  It generates a 0V-centered
	sine wave on channel 1.  This sine wave has an amplitude of &plusmn;2.5V and a 
	period of 16 clock cycles. Channel 2 generates a square wave with an amplitude
	of &plusmn;2.5V and a period of 4 clock cycles.


	<li><a href="./code/acquireToHDMI_package.vhd">acquireToHDMI_package.vhd</a><br>
	You will need to put all the constants associated with your control and status
	words in this package.  You should also put the component descriptions of your
	the top-level acquireToHDMI module along with the datapath and control units.

	<li><a href="./code/acquireToHDMI_tb.vhd">acquireToHDMI_tb.vhd</a><br>
	This is the top-level simulation file. There is nothing in here to edit. You 
	should make your component declarations to match the naming in this file. This 
	will ensure that your naming works with the xdc file (the pin assignment file).

	<li><a href="./code/acquireToHDMI_tbWaveSetup.tcl">acquireToHDMI_tbWaveSetup.tcl</a>
	This is the waveform setup file that you will use in your simulation. The instructions 
	on how to use this file are contained in the comments. Load this as a simuation source
	to save you time when starting your simulation.  That said, I would  suggest that you 
	edit these instructions to make them consistent with your development environment. This 
	will save you time everytime you need to rerun a simulation.

	<li><a href="./code/acquireToHDMI_fsm.vhdl">acquireToHDMI_fsm.vhdl</a><br>
	This is the control unit. You should look at the example code posted in the 
	lecture notes for pointers on the logic and code syntax.

	<li><a href="./code/acquireToHDMI_datapath.vhdl">acquireToHDMI_datapath.vhdl</a><br>
	This is the datapath. You will need to instantiate basic building blocks and route 
	the status and control word signals correctly. You should use lots of constants in 
	your acquireToHDMI package to make your VHDL code more intuitive and thus easier to debug.

	<li><a href="./code/acquireToHDMI.vhd">acquireToHDMI.vhd</a><br>
	This is the top-level synthesis module. Use the acquireToHDMI package to store the 
	component declarations for the datapath and control.

	<li><a href="./code/acquireToHDMI.xdc">acquireToHDMI.xdc</a><br>
	This is the important part of the pin assignment file.  You will be able to complete
	the rest of this file using the xdc files from the previous labs.

</ul>


<h2>Simulation</h2>
In order to verify that the forced and triggered modes of your oscilloscope work you will 
perform two separate simulations; one in forced mode and one in trigger mode.  To do
this you will need to modify that testbench by including or commenting out the following line
of code in the acquireToHDMI_tb.vhd file:
<br><img width=300 src="./img/switchBtwForcedTrigger.png"><br><br>

Now that you have your files setup to run the simulation properly, you will want to setup your
waveforms.  In order to accommodate the more than 60 signals, you will use signal groups.
A signal group is a related set of signals under a collapsible header that is opened/closed when
you click on the ">" icon next to the group name.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">

<h2>Synthesis</h2>
You will need to complete the XDC file provided the the codes section.  You should be able
to get most of the pin assignments from your previous labs.  Consult the AX7010 technical
documents for any other pin assignments you might need.
<br><br>

The daughter boards allow you to connect a stereo signal, a function generator or use the
POTs as the input voltage source.  Use the 3-position slide switch to determine the source.
You can use <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~jfalkinburg/husker-scope/">Husker Scope</a> to generate
the waveforms shown in the photograph shown at the top of this lab.  Since the ADC is calibrated
for a range of &plusmn; 5V, make sure that, if you are using a function generator,  your waveform 
is limited to &plusmn; 5V.
<br><br>

If you re experiencing a lot of noise on your digitized waveform and false triggering, the
source may very well be the sub-par power supplies.  I've procured a few high quality 
AC/DC supplies that I can lend out.  Please do NOT supply this board with anything higher
than 5V.  Current needs to be at least 2Amps with 4-8Amps being the much better option.
