<h1>Lab 3 - Data Acquisition, Storage and Display</h1>

<h2>Lab Overview</h2>
The signal acquire module contains a datapath and control necessary
to initiate and acquire all 8 channels of the AD7606 chip and store
them into a register file.  And yes, we will only be using the first
two channels on our oscilloscope, we will  gather the extra 6 channels.

<br><img width=800 src="./img/timing.png"><br><br>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
You will build the signal acquisition engine using a datapath and control approach.

<br><img src="./img/lab03architecture.png"><br><br>

You will use a testbench to verify that your design works as a simulation.  In order
to verify proper operation of the synthesized design, you will ask the register file
for the value of register 0 and send the output to four comparators.  The comparators
will compare the channel 1 converted value against the 16-bit 2's complement value
for 1, 2, 3 and 4 volts.<br>
The button process is similar to the last lab, it will look for a change in the logic
level of one of the buttons (which I don't care).  When the button process sees a change
in this button's logic level, it will enable the trigger status word for one clock cycle.

<h2>Control Unit</h2>
The control unit should follow the processes outlined in class.  Use a model where
you separate the state process from the output process.  Liberally use constants 
and alias to make your code more readable.  Use easy to understand state names as
these are what you will see during your simulation.

<h2>Datapath</h2>
The datapath contains two counter/comparator pairs to generate a short
and long delay.  You should configure the long delay to be around 
1.3ms in your synthesized design.

<pre>
CONSTANT LONG_DELAY_50Mhz_COUNTS : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(LONG_DELAY_50Mhz_CONST_WIDTH - 1 downto 0) := x"00FFFF";
</pre>

You should then include the package in your datapath.vhdl file and then you can use this constant in
the long delay comparator instantation.  This should look something like the following.

<pre>
	longDelayCompare_inst: genericCompare
        GENERIC MAP(24)
        PORT MAP(   x =&gt; longDelayCounter,
                    y =&gt; LONG_DELAY_50Mhz_COUNTS,
                    g =&gt; open,
                    l =&gt; open,
                    e =&gt; sw(LONG_DELAY_DONE_SW_BIT_INDEX));
</pre>

In addition to the two counter/comparator pairs, your datapath will also need to include
a register file to store the 16-bit values returned from the AD7606


<h2>Register File</h2>

You will use the register file to store the 16-bit data from all 8 channels.  Thus,
your register file will have 8-storage location (registers), that can store 16-bits
each.  The internal organization of the register file is shown in the following 
figure.

<br><img src="./img/regFile.png"><br><br>

To write data into the register file, you:
<ul>	<li>Assert data on the D input
	<li>Assert the index of the register you want to store the data to on the
	wrAddr input
	<li>Assert the write control input
</ul>

Since the data output is separate from the data input, to read data all you need to
do is assert the index of the register you want to read on the rdAddr input.  The
relevant register output is selected by the 8:1 mux and will appear on the Q output.
<br><br>


<h2>VHDL Code</h2>
The files below will give you a solid start on this lab.  Note package files are a bit 
tricky to find.  To do so, go to the Sources pane and click on the 'libraries' tab.  
You should find them under Design Sources -> VHDL -> xil_defaultlib
<ul>	
	<li><a href="./code/basicBuildingBlocksVhdl.zip"> basicBuildingBlocksVhdl.zip</a><br>
	This folder contains all the VHDL basic building blocks you can use to build the
	datapath elements as well as the package declaration that you will need to include
	at the top of any file which uses one of these components.  Read the comments at the
	top of the package file for instructions on how to use this package.  You should put
	your register file in this folder and you will need to add the component declaration
	for the register file in the package file.

	<li><a href="./code/an7606.vhd">an7606.vhd</a><br>
	This is a simulation only artifact that emulates the behavior of the AD7606 chip.
	Use this component in your testbench simulation to verify operation of your 
	design.

	<li><a href="./code/signalAcquire_Package.vhd">signalAcquire_Package.vhd</a><br>
	This package contains:
	<ul>	<li>Project specific component declarations
		<li>Project specific simulation clk_period
		<li>Constants defining the width of control and status words
		<li>Indexes for specific bits of the control and status words
		<li>Constants for four voltages represented as 16-bit 2's complement values
	</ul>
	Anywhere you find a commented out line with "?", you should replace the question mark
	with a constant value.  I would highly recommend annotating your values on a diagram
	of your datapath so that you can understand your testbench simulation behavior.

	<li><a href="./code/signalAcquire_tb.vhd">signalAcquire_tb.vhd</a><br>
	This is the top-level simulation file.  There is nothing in here to edit.  You should
	make your component declarations to match the naming in this file.  This will ensure
	that your naming works with the xdc file (the pin assignment file).

	<li><a href="./code/signalAcquire_tbWaveSetup.tcl">signalAcquire_tbWaveSetup.tcl</a><br>
	This is the waveform setup file that you will use in your simulation.  Add this file to
	your simulation sources and it will automatically load every time you run a simulation,
	a great time saver.

	<li><a href="./code/signalAcquireFsm.vhdl">signalAcquireFsm.vhdl</a><br>
	This is the control unit.  You should look at the example code posted in the lecture
	notes for pointers on the logic and code syntax.

	<li><a href="./code/signalAcquireDatapath.vhdl">signalAcquireDatapath.vhdl</a><br>
	This is the datapath.  You will need to instantiate basic building blocks and
	route the status and control word signals correctly.  You should use lots of
	constants in your signalAcquire package to make your VHDL code more 
	intuitive and thus easier to debug.

	<li><a href="./code/signalAcquire.vhd">signalAcquire.vhd</a><br>
	This is the top-level synthesis module.  Use the signal acquire package to store
	the component declarations for the datapath and control.

	<li><a href="./code/signalAcquire.xdc">signalAcquire.xdc </a><br>
	This is the pin assignment file for the signalAcquire module.  You will need to
	use the ALINX AX7010 Board Schematic posted on the class web page to
	determine the pins for the missing entries in this file.
</ul>

<h2>Simulation</h2>
To help you in debugging, I've provided some excerpts from my testbench simulation. If you right-click on the images and open in a new window, they will enlarge.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr> <td>Up To 200ns</td>	<td><img width=400 src="./img/upTo200ns.png"></td></tr>
<tr> <td>At 1,311,800ns</td>	<td><img width=400 src="./img/at1311800ns.png"></td></tr>
<tr> <td>At 1,316,200ns</td>	<td><img width=400 src="./img/at1316200ns.png"></td></tr>
<tr> <td>At 1,318,200ns</td> 	<td><img width=400 src="./img/at1318200ns.png"></td></tr>
<tr> <td>At 1,321,700ns</td>	<td><img width=400 src="./img/at1321700ns.png"></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Synthesis</h2>
You will need to complete the xdc (pin assignment) file before you can successfully 
synthesize your design.  This will require you to work through the schematic and 
look for the connections between the devices and pins on the Zynq chip.  You will also
need to open up the AN706 ADC board schematic to identity which pins on the 40-pin
connector are connected to the AD7060.
<br><br>

Once you get the project to synthesize, you will need to connect the AN706+interface
board to the J10 header.  Please take care when doing this as mis-alignment of the pins
can cause the header pins to get damaged.<br><br>

To use the interface board:
<ul>	<li>Slide the ON/OFF switch into the ON position.  When you do this a nearby
	(green) LED will illuminate.
	<li>Switch the channel 1 selector into the "P" position.  P stands for 
	potentiometer.  Note there is a small "CH1" silk screened next to the 
	audio jack to help you determine which side of the board is channel 1.
	<li>Adjust the channel 1 potentiometer while pressing the PL_KEY4. The
	LEDs should change.
</ul>

The image below shows me adjusting the channel 1 potentiometer.  Since this is an 
early revision of the interface board, you may notice small differences to the 
interface board that you use in lab.
