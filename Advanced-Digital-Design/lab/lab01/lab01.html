<h1>Lab 1 - Enhanced PWM</h1>
In this lab, you will write a VHDL code for a PWM controller that 
can be used for a variety of purposes including the first stage of
a PWM digital to analog converter (DAC).  After completing the code,
you will test the PWM module using a testbench to make sure that it
functions as intended.



<h2>Overview</h2>
A pulse width modulated (PWM) waveform has a constant period and a
variable duty cycle.  The duty cycle of a waveform is the time
high divided by the period, usually represented as a percentage.
In our case, the duty cycle is a integer between 0 and 256.  
<ul>
<li>When the duty cycle is 0, the PWM waveform spends 100% of its 
time at logic 0.  
<li>When the duty cycle is 256, the PWM waveform spends 100% of its 
time at logic 1.  
</ul>
It may take a moment of reflection to appreciate that the duty cycle
is a 9-bit integer.
<br><br>

Let's flex our ability to decribe a digital component using the
format introduced to decribe basic building blocks.


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Other		<td>1-bit clock and 1-bit, active low resetn
<tr><td>Data input 	<td>9-bit duty cycle
<tr><td>Data output	<td>1-bit pwmSignal, 8-bit pwmCount
<tr><td>Control input 	<td>1-bit enable
<tr><td>Status output	<td>1-bit rollOver
<tr><td>Behavior	<td>When enabled, the pwmOutput signal is a PWM 
			waveform whose period is 256 counts.  The duty 
			cycle of pwmOutput is given by the dutyCycle input.
			When disabled, pwmOutput is static holding at either
			logic 0 or logic 1.  The dutyCycle is loaded only when
			the internal counter rolls over to 0.  When this occurs,
			the rollOver output pulses to logic 1 for a single cycle.
			The internal counter's value is sen to the pwmCount 
			output.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
The design of Lab 1 is broken down into separate modules, some of which
are provided for you and some which you will need to create.  The
interconnection of the modules is illustrated in the following schematic.
When a signal name appears just inside a box, that should should correspond
to the name of that signal in the entity description.

<h2>VHDL Code</h2>
In order to get you going in this lab, some of the VHDL code has been 
provided for you. In most cases, you should refrain from changing the
modules given.  In order to get a better understanding how these modules 
interact with one another, the following section provides a schematic
and the input, output and behavior of some of the modules.

<ul>	<li><a href="./code/basicBuildingBlocksVhdl.zip">basicBuildingBlocksVhdl</a>

</ul>




<h2>Simulation</h2>
You will need to run simulations to make sure that all your 
videoSignalGenerator is producing the correct waveforms.  I've 
included a testbench file and TCL setup script to help you setup
the testbench. 

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Signal		<td>Color	<td>Radix
<tr><td>clk		<td>Green	<td>binary
<tr><td>resetn		<td>Green	<td>binary
<tr><td>enb		<td>Blue	<td>binary

<tr><td>pwmSignal	<td>Gold	<td>unsigned
<tr><td>rollOver 	<td>Gold	<td>unsigned

<tr><td>pwmCount	<td>Purple	<td>unsigned
<tr><td>dutyCycle	<td>Purple	<td>unsigned

<tr><td>E255		<td>Red 	<td>binary
<tr><td>dutyGrPwmCount	<td>Red 	<td>binary
<tr><td>counterControl	<td>Red 	<td>binary
</table>

To help you in debugging, I've prodvided some excerpts from my 
testbench simulation.  If you right-click on the images and
open in a new window, they will enlarge.  Your output should 
be identical.

<tr><td>Up to 50us </td><td>  <img width=300 src="./img/simUoTo50us.bmp"> </td> </tr>
