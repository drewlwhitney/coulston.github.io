<h1>Software control of the enhancedPwm hardware</h1>
The purpose of this lab is to work through the tool chain to build a
stand-alone piece of hardware that interfaces to the Arm Coretex-A9.

<br><img src="./img/armWithEnhancedPwm.PNG"><br><br>

<h2>Interface enhancedPwm to AXI bus</h2>
The first step of this process will be to wrap the enhancedPwm
module inside a pair of wrapper files, enhancedPwm_ip_v_0.vhd and
enhancedPwm_ip_v_0_S00_AXI.vhd.  
This process is described in the 
<a href="../../howTo/howTo 08 Build IP For Zynq.docx ">Build IP</a>
document. This file is also available at the top of the main page
under the HowTo pull-down.



<h2>Interface AXI compatible enhancedPwm to ARM A9</h2>
The result of the previous step is a IP block that you can place
on a block diagram.  In this step, you will interface the enhancedPwm 
IP block to the ARM Coretex-A9 in the block diagram editor.  As part
of this process, you will configure the ARM-A9, an involved process.
When complete you will have the following block diagram.

<br><img src="../../lecture/img/armWithEnhancedPwmBlock.PNG"><br><br>

This process is described in the 
<a href="../../howTo 09 Interface IP to the Zynq.docx">Interface IP to the Arm-A9</a>
document. This file is also available at the top of the main page
under the HowTo pull-down.

<h2>Use Vitis to program ARM-A9</h2>
The result of the previous step is a wrapper file that you will import
into the Vitis development environment.  This is a tricky process which
is described in the 
<a href="../../howTo/howTo 10 Program IP.docx">Communicate with IP through the Zynq</a>
document. This file is also available at the top of the main page
under the HowTo pull-down.  <br><br>

<h2>Use Interrupts with the ARM-A9</h2>
Once you get the previous step working, you are pretty much done.  In order
to understand the relationship between the TTC interrupt and the ARM-A9, 
you can read the
<br><a href="../../howTo/howTo 12 TTC Interrupt.docx">Program with the Zynq interrupt</a>
document. This file is also available at the top of the main page
under the HowTo pull-down.


In order to complete this process, you will need some code.  You should find
this <a href="./code/helloworld.c">helloworld.c</a> performs all the actions
needed to exercise the enhancedPwm and TTC.<br><br>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
When everything is up and running, connect the output of the PWM channel on 
J11 pin 3 to one of the low pass filter inputs on the grand-daughter board.
You

Connect to the Zynq through the serial port created through the 
Silicon Labs CP210x chip.  The putty terminal should look like the following:
<br><img width=400 src="./img/putty.png"><br><br>

Experiment with the sin wave function to generate a sinwave output
from the low pass filter on the grand-daughter boards.  When connected to
to an oscilloscope, the PWM waveform (bottom) and its low pass filtered
output (top) will look like the following.
