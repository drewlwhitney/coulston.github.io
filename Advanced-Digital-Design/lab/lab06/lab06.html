<h1>Software control of custom IP hardware</h1>
The goal of this lab is to allow you to create a hardware and software system
that can function as a function generator and oscilloscope.  

<h3>C-level Functionality</h3>
This level of functionality will earn a 75% grade.  The requirements:
<ul>	<li>A function generator that can generate a sine waveform.
	<li>An oscilloscope 
	<li>A "hand" drawn schematic of your IP inside the the xyz_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI
	file.  I need you to understand what signals you are sending outside the
	chip and which you are sending to the ARM-A9.
<br><img width=200 src="../lab05/img/armWithEnhancedPwm.PNG"><br>
	
</ul>
The user should be able to interact with the hardware on a serial interface 
running on the ARM-A9.  This interface should allow the user to
<ul>	<li>Adjust the trigger voltage of the oscilloscope.
	<li>Adjust the frequency of the function generator output.
</ul>

<h3>B-level Functionality</h3>
This level of functionality will earn an 85% grade.  The requirements are all the
requirements of C-level functionality plus the following.
<ul>	<li>A function generator that:
	<ul>	<li>Can generate two different period waveform, a sine wave and a sinc wave.
		<li>Has a frequency resolution of exactly 1Hz.
		<li>Uses a 64 entry LUT.	
	</ul>
	<li>An oscilloscope 
	<ul>	<li>That sends the channel 1 and 2 data to the ARM-A9
    <li>A "hand" drawn schematic of your IP inside the the xyz_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI
        file.  I need you to understand what signals you are sending outside the
        chip and which you are sending to the ARM-A9.
<br><img width=200 src="../lab05/img/armWithEnhancedPwm.PNG"><br>

	</ul>
</ul>
The user should be able to interact with the hardware on a serial interface 
running on the ARM-A9.  This interface should allow the user to
<ul>	<li>Adjust the trigger voltage of the oscilloscope.
	<li>Select which period waveform is output on the function generator.
	<li>Adjust the frequency of the function generator output.
	<li>Display the last 64 values of channel 1 or channel 2.  These samples
	need to be taken at the sampling rate.  This means that you need to send
	a status signal to the ARM-A9.  Consider incorporating a 
	<a href="./code/flagRegister.vhdl">flag register</a>
	in your acquireToHdmi component.
</ul>

<h3>A-level Functionality</h3>
This level of functionality will earn an 95% grade.  The requirements are all the requirements
of B-level functionality (where they do not conflict), plus the following.
<ul>	<li>A 2-channel function generator that:
	<ul>	<li>Can generate two different period waveform, a sine wave and a sinc wave.
		<li>Be enabled or disabled.  When disabled, the output goes to 0V DC.
		<li>Perform a frequency sweep.
	</ul>
	<li>An oscilloscope that:
	<ul>	<li>Four different sampling rates
	</ul>
    <li>A "hand" drawn schematic of your IP inside the the xyz_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI
        file.  I need you to understand what signals you are sending outside the
        chip and which you are sending to the ARM-A9.
<br><img width=200 src="../lab05/img/armWithEnhancedPwm.PNG"><br>

</ul>
The user should be able to interact with the hardware on a serial interface 
running on the ARM-A9.  This interface should allow the user to
<ul>	<li>Adjust function generator mode between off, fixed frequency and sweep.
	<li>Adjust the start, end and duration of the frequency sweep.
	<li>Select which periodic waveform is output on the function generator.
	<li>Display the peak-to-peak voltage of the waveform on channel 1 and 2.
	<li>Display the frequency of the waveform on channel 1 and channel 2.  You can
	assume that the input is sinusoidal for this function.
</ul>

<h3>Bonus</h3>
Up to 5% of bonus points will be awarded for incorporating some hardware/software
functionality not covered in the class.  For example:
<ul>	<li>Incorporate AXI_GPIO to your ARM-A9 and write software that shows
	you can read and write GPIO.
	<li>Write an ISR triggered by Core0_nFIQ 
	<li>Get creative, surprise me.
</ul>


<h3>Flag register</h3>
I've provided some code for an interface mechanism that allows your custom IP
to send status information to your ARM-A9. The reason that you may need this
register is because, often times, the status bits that your IP sends are valid
for a single clock cycle, but the software running on the ARM-A9 may not get 
around to checking that status bit for a while.  When the ARM-A9 gets around to
checking the status bit, it may be gone.<br><br>

<pre>
entity flagRegister is
	generic (N: integer := 8);
	port(	clk: in  STD_LOGIC;
		resetn : in  STD_LOGIC;
		set, clear: in std_logic_vector(N-1 downto 0);
		Q: out std_logic_vector(N-1 downto 0));
end flagRegister;
</pre>


The flag register solves this problem using a "sticky" status bit.  In other words
your IP status bit connects to the set input of the flag register to set the Q bit 
output of the flag regster to logic 1. The Q output of the flag register is sent to
ARM-A9 through one of the SLV_REGx memory mapped registers.  Since the Q output is
"sticky" it stays set until cleared.  This way the ARM-A9 can take its time to read
the status bit. When the ARM-A9 is done reading the "sticky status bit, it can clear
this bit back to logic 0 by writing the flag register's clear input through one
of the memory mapped SLV_REGy.  The cycle is now ready to repeat.  And yes, this is
<u>exactly</u> the same process used on the PIC 18F26K22 status register - think the
TMR0IOF bit of the TMR0CON register.
