<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two,
read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions
prescribed.  You do not need to document bullet items.  Make a
record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy
as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.
<Br><Br>

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions.
Use complete English sentences when answering questions.  If the
answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an
oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the
piece of art.  Only include your answers, do not include
the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.



<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to introduce you to the MPLAB Code 
Configurator (MCC) and how to use delays to generate sounds.
<br><img src="./img/speaker2sound2music.bmp"><br><br>

<h2>External Hardware</h2>
Today you will write code that you can interact with through a button
(input) and generate musical tones through the speaker (output).  You
should be familiar with the operation of the buttons from last week's 
lab.  Since this lab is already jam packed with goodness, we will
wait until next week's lab to explore the hardware on your development
board that converts the low power output from the PIC into a 
high power signal to drive the speakers.


<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
This lab will use one of the GPIO pins as an output driving the speaker
and two of the GPIO pins to read the push buttons.<br><Br> 

In order to use the speaker you need to install a 2 pin jumper (shown
below) over the pair of pins 5V (near the USB connector).   Leave
this jumper in place until you need 5v or want to measure the current
consumed by the development board.
<br><img src="./img/jumper.jpg"><br><br>

We will compare the  delay generating paradigm used in last 
week's lab, having the processor idly execute NOP instructions to 
create delays, and timers.  NOPs are useful in simple applications
and where you need to create very brief delays.  However, in order 
to generate more precise 
delays, or to allow the micrcontroller to perform other work while 
waiting for the delay to be over, you will need to learn to use timers.
While you may question the benefit of the 
added complexity timers introduce into your code, I hope that you will 
soon realize that they represent one of the most powerful subsystems in a 
microcontroller.<br><br>


<h2>Firmware Organization</h2>
A microcontroller by itself is not terribly interesting, being not much more 
than a slow-running processor.  Microcontrollers derive their power from 
the subsystems they contain and the external devices these subsystems can 
control.  In order to be able to interface to as many different external 
devices as possible, the computer engineers who design microcontrollers make
the subsystems as flexible as possible.  This means that there are potentially
a great number of alternative configurations for each subsystem.  When 
developing an embedded application that interfaces a microcontroller subsystem 
to an external device, one of the first tasks you must complete is configuring
the subsystem.  <br><br>

In my experience subsystem configuration is a necessary task that can
turn into a time consuming and potentially-frustrating challenge.   
Thankfully, the folks at Microchips 
developed the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) to address this challenge.
Paraphrasing the text in the MPLAB® Code Configurator User’s Guide,
MCC is a plug-in tool in MPLAB X which generates drivers (software) for 
controlling and driving subsystems based on the settings and selections 
made in the Graphical User Interface. The generated drivers can be used 
in your program.

<h3>Create new project</h3>
The first step to using MCC is to create a new project
and launch MCC as described in the steps below.

<ul>
<li>Launch MPLab X
<li>Close any open project: File &rarr; Close All Projects,
<li>Create a new inLab03 project as you did in Lab 2,
<li>Click  Tools &rarr; Embedded &rarr; MPLab Code Configurator v4: Open/Close,
<li>At the MCC Content Manager Wizard screen:
<ul>	<li>Click on the blue button "Select MCC Classic" in the center tile,
	<li>On the next page click on the blue "Finish" button
</ul>
<li>If the MPLab Code Configurator is not listed then you will need
to install the Code Configurator as follows,
<ul>	<li>Tools &rarr; Plugins,
	<li>In the Plugins pop-up select the "Installed" tab,
	<li>Type "code" into the search box on the right side of the pop-up,
	<li>Check the "MPLab Code Configurator" check box, 
	<li>Click Activate,
	<li>Click Finish in the Plugin Installer pop-up,
	<li>Click OK on any Confirmation dialog pop-ups.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configure the PIC with MCC</h3>
You should use MCC for the remainder of the term for all future projects.
Every project in this class will require you to configure the oscillator
and I/O pins as shown in the steps below.  Consult the figure below the
text in case you have difficulty finding some of the selections described.
<br><br>

If you installed the plugin correctly, there should be a blue shield icon in
the toolbar labeled “MCC”. This is the code configurator. Click the
icon and hit “save” when given an option to save your configuration files.
See the image below for assistance in locating buttons described in the 
following instructions.

<ul>
<li>In the INTERNAL OSCILLATOR area of the System Module window
<ul>	<li>Oscillator Select:	Internal oscillator block
	<li>System Clock Select: FOSC
	<li>Internal Clock: 16MHz_HFINTOSC
	<li>Software PLL Enabled: &check;
</ul>
The Current System clock (at the top) should be 64MHz (4x PLL).
If the system clock says 16MHz, you have created your project incorrectly. 
Please go back and re-create your project, as this will cause issues in the 
future. 

<li>In the Pin Manager: Grid [MCC] tab of the console window
click on the open lock in the Port A, 2 column and in the GPIO input row.
The blue background color should switch to a green closed lock, meaning that 
RA2 is now locked as an input. The blue open lock one row below (in the output
row) should have change color to orange meaning that RA2 is not an output,
<li>In the Pin Manager: Grid [MCC] tab of the console window
click on the open lock in the PortA 3 column and in the GPIO input row,
<li>In the Pin Manager: Grid [MCC] tab of the console window
click on the open lock in the PortB 5 column and in the GPIO output row,
<li>In the Project Resources area of the project window, click 
"Pin Module".  The editor window will change from the System Module to
Pin Module. Click on the Custom Name text box in the RA2 row and change 
the name of RA2 from "IO_RA2" to "TOP_BUTTON",
<li>Change the name of RA3 to "BOTTOM_BUTTON",
<li>Change the name of RB5 to "SPEAKER_PIN",
<li>In the Pin Module in the Analog column, uncheck analog for RB5 if
	it is selected,
<li>In the Device Resources window (at left) scroll down and find the
"Timer" list (has a watch icon).  Expand this list and double click 
on "TMR1".  Two things will happen; the main window will change to
show the TMR1 configuration options and second, TMR1 will appear in the
Peripherals list in the Project Resources area.  Use the following to
configure timer 1.  Note where you see "&check;", it means to put a check
in a box.  Where you see "&square;" it means to leave the check box empty.
If a configuration option is not listed it means that option is unimportant.

<ul>	<li>Enable Timer:	&check;
	<li>Clock Source:	FOSC/4
	<li>Prescaler:		1:1
	<li>Timer Period:	4.096 ms
</ul>

<li>Click on the "Generate" button in the Project Resources area of the
project manager window.  Anytime that you make a change to the configuration
you must re-generate the supporting files exported into your project using
the "Generate" button.  If you have the output console open you will see
MCC generating the files you specified in this configuration.
</ul>

<br><img src="./img/codeConfig.jpg"><br>

<h3>Add source code</h3>
In addition to generating the code to configure the PIC, MCC generates
a variety of useful function and definitions that you can call from
inside your code.  In this lab, I have written a simple program that
uses some of these definitions.   In the steps below, you will 
add this program to your project.

<ul>
<li>Start by switching the main project tab from the Project Resources
view, back to your project manager view (left-most tab),
<li>Expand the "Source File" folder,
<li>Double click the file main.c to open it in the editor window.
<li>Replace the contents of main.c with <a href="./code/inlab03.c">inlab03.c</a>
<li>In main.c, edit the number of NOPs in the microSecondDelay function to
correctly generate a microsecond delay.  This is necessary because slight 
changes in the compiler changes the number of NOPs needed.
</ul>

Before running the inLab03.c program, take a moment to
look at the structure of the files created by MCC and the utility functions
and definitions contained in them.  
In the project manager window expand Header Files &rarr; MCC Generated 
File.  Double click and open all the files in this folder.  Use the contents 
of the files to answer the following questions.

<ol start=1>
<li>What three defined expressions are available for you to write values
to the Speaker?  Hint, these all manipulate the Latch and contain a set
of parentheses.
<li>What defined expression can you call in your code to get the value
of TOP_BUTTON?  Hint, it's not TOP_BUTTON_PORT - we want a similar
expression that has parenthesis.
<li>List all the functions that you can call to interact with timer 1.
</ol>

In the project manager window expand Source Files &rarr; MCC Generated File.
Double click and open mcc.c, pin_manager.c, and TMR1.c in this folder.  Use 
the contents of these files to answer the following questions.

<ol start=4>
<li>What functions does the SYSTEM_Initialize call?
<li>How does the MCC TMR1_ReadTimer function form the 16-bit timer value
from the two 8-bit timer 1 registers?
</ol>

In the project manager window double click and open main.c. Use the 
contents of main.c to answer the following questions.

<ol start=6>
<li>List all the calls in main.c to definitions contained in the 
MCC Generated Header Files.  To answer this question, look through all
the "#define" statements in the Header Files generated by MCC.  Write
down any of these "#define" statements that you can find in main.c.
For example, main.c calls TOP_BUTTON_GetValue() (from pin_manager.h) 
so this should be included as part of your answer.  Also, all of the
#define values are shown in light blue text.  Note, some of these
#defines are declared in main.c - do not include these, only ones
declared in the MCC Generated Header Files.

<li>List all the calls in main.c to functions contained in the 
MCC Generated Source Files. To answer this question, look through all
the functions declared in the Source Files generated by MCC.  Write
down any of these function declarations that you can find in main.c.
For example, main.c calls TMR1_WriteTimer() (from tmr1.c) so this should be
included as part of your answer.


<li>Given the configuration of the push buttons discussed in a previous lab,
when will the instructions inside the while-loop on lines
44-45 be executed, when the top button is being pressed or unpressed?  
<li> When will the instructions on lines 47,48 be executed,
when the top button is pressed or when the button is released?
</ol>

<h2>Firmware Operation</h2>
Your next step will be to download the firmware into the PIC, then run and 
observe the behavior of the program.  Using MCC does not require you to 
change this process; so the following steps should be familiar.

<ul>
<li>Connect the development board to a USB port on the PC,
<li>Connect the SNAP programmer to a USB port on the PC,
<li>Connect the SNAP programmer to the development board so that the 
triangle on the SNAP programmer and the development board align,
<li>In the toolbar click on the Clean and Build Project icon (hammer and
broom).  If you get an error, it most likely a result of naming the
buttons differently than I described above.  Either fix the name of the
pins in the code configurator (and re-generate) or modify the names of
the pins in the inlab03 code.
<li>In the toolbar click on the Run Project icon (green arrow pointing right),
<li>Check the "Do not show this message again" checkbox in the
MPLab pop-up and then click OK,
<li>Three things will now happen that should alert you that the download
is in progress:
<ul>    <li>Text will scroll by in the SNAP programmer tab of the console ending with
        <font face="courier">Programming/Verify complete</font>,
        <li>The lower right corner of the MPLab X window you should see
        "inlab03 (Build, Load)" with a progress bar flashing,
</ul>
<li>Add a jumper wire from RB5 to the LPF_in pin.  Place a 2-pin jumper
over the LPF_out/AMP_in 2-pin header.
</ul>
Setting up the oscilloscope probe for this experiments can be a bit 
tricky, the image below is one way you can accomplish.
<br><img width=500 src="./img/probeRB5setup.jpg"><br><br>



<h3>Observe output</h3>
One of the primary reasons electrical engineers use oscilloscopes is to
observe phenomena that are too fast and too small to be observed directly
with something like a digital multimeter.  In the following steps, you 
will use the oscilloscope to observe the signal, generated by your
program, coming from RB5.  

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>RB5
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>1 ms
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>1V
<tr><td>Trigger type		<td>Edge
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&uarr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.5V
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li><font color=green>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule.</font>
	See green text in image below for clairfication,
	<li><font color=red>Align the horizontal position at the second 
	left-most reticule.</font>
	See red text in image below for clarification,
	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>
	[&uarr;Back]
	<li>Screen shot the screen on USB:<br>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Format</u> &rarr; 
	<u>24-bit Bit... (*.bmp)</u>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Press to Save</u>
</ul>

<br><img src="./img/scopeSetup.bmp"><br><br>

 
<ol start=10>
<li>Include the screenshot (saved on a thumbdrive) of the 980Hz note waveform
generated while pressing the top button.This will be the note that plays
on the first button press. If you missed it, just press the top button
a few more times to cycle back around. You can verify that you have
the right note by measuring the frequency of your waveform 
([Meas] &rarr; Add Meas &rarr; Type: Frequency &rarr; Source 1 &rarr; 
Add Measurement).

<li>Using the time per division information on the oscilloscope screen shot and
the duration of the waveform (described in divisions), show your calculation 
for the period of the waveform on RB5.   Invert the period to also determine the
frequency.  For example, if your oscilloscope was
set to 250us/division and the waveform had a period of 4.6 divisions, then
your answer would look like:
<pre>
Oscilloscope set to 250us/division
The period of the RB5 waveform is 4.6 divisions

	 250us      
	-------- *  4.6 divisions = 1,150us	1/1,150us = 869Hz
	division 
</pre>

</ol>


<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
Your program uses delays to generate the musical notes in a
traditional western music scale.  The code to generate notes
using TOP_BUTTON is similar to this:
<pre>
            while (TOP_BUTTON_GetValue() == 0) {            
                microSecondDelay(halfPeriod[i]);                
                SPEAKER_PIN_Toggle();
            } // end pressed button  
</pre>

In order to generate frequencies that correspond to the notes in a
traditional musical scale, you need to understand the mathematical
relationship between a note and its frequency as described in the first 
paragraph of the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">Equal temperament</a>
wikipedia page.  You will use an excel spreadsheet to compute the 
halfPeriods (from the code snippet above) of the notes A<sub>4</sub> &hellip; 
D<sup>#</sup><sub>6</sub>.  Follow these steps to complete this task.

<ul>
<li>Launch excel and select a blank workbook,
<li>Left click just to the left of the word "Index" in the table below,
<li>Hold down the left mouse button and drag to the lower right cell
in the table (the row with index 31),
<li>Right mouse click and select "Copy"
<li>Return to the Excel work sheet.  Right click in cell A1,
select "Keep Source Formatting (K)" under "Paste Options".
If this does not work, then you will need to complete the following 
red steps.
<ul>
<font color="red">
	<li>Enter "Index", &hellip; "Half period (ms)" in cells 
	A1 &hellip; E1.
	<li>Enter "0" in cell A2
	<li>Enter "=A2+1" in cell A3
	<li>Select cell A3, click and drag the small green square in the lower 
	right corner of cell A3 down to cell A33.  This will reproduce the 
	formula that you typed in cell A3 into cells A4 &hellip; A33, except
	that the "A2" reference will be replaced with the relative 
	reference to the cell above.   For example, check that the formula in 
	cell A10 will be "=A9+1".
	<li>Enter the note names in cells B2 &hellip; B33,
	<li>Enter "440" in cell C2 and 31000 in cell C33,
</font>
</ul>
<li>Next you will write an Excel formula to compute the frequency (in Hz)
of each note in the table.  In cell C3 enter the formula for the next
note above 440, using the
excel functions "power".  Use the "round" function to limit the numerical
precision of the cell to 0 significant figures.  If you are stuck refer back
to the Wiki page for 'Equal temperament'.  Hint: you should have 
something like, "=round(C2*power(?,?),0)" where the "?" are numerical values. 
<li>Select cell C3, click and drag the small green square in the lower 
right corner of cell C3 down to cell C32.  This will reproduce the 
formula that you typed in cell C3 with a relative replacement of "C2",
<li>In cell D2 enter the formula for the period of the waveform with the
frequency given in cell C2.  Use the round function to limit the numerical
precision of the fraction to 3 significant figures.  Make sure to use units
of ms for the period.
<li>Select cell D2, click and drag the small green square in the lower 
right corner of cell D2 down to cell D33.  This will reproduce the 
formula that you typed in cell D2 with a relative replacement of "C2",
<li>In cell E2 enter the formula for half the period of the waveform
period in cell D2.  Round the numerical precision of the fraction to 3
significant figures.  Copy the formula into cells E3 &hellip; E33,
</ul>

Your program also uses timer delays to generate the musical notes 
using BOTTOM_BUTTON is similar to this:
<pre>
            while (BOTTOM_BUTTON_GetValue() == 0) { 
                TMR1_WriteTimer(0x10000 - halfPeriodTimer[i]);
                PIR1bits.TMR1IF = 0;
                while(TMR1_HasOverflowOccured() == false);
                SPEAKER_PIN_Toggle();
            } // end pressed button   
</pre>

<br>
<u>Please note that TMR1 operates identically to TMR0.</u>  That
means that TMR1 counts up at F<sub>osc</sub>/4.  Since you configured
F<sub>osc</sub> = 64MHz, then TMR1 counts up 16,000,000 times a second.
<br><br>

In order to generate frequencies using timer 1 counts, you need to 
reinterpret the half periods in column E in terms of timer 1 counts.
To do this let's start by writing an equation which converts a delay
in milliseconds into 1:1 prescaled timer 1 counts.

<ol start=12>
<li>Write a dimensional analysis equation to convert a half period delay
in milliseconds into 1:1 prescaled timer 1 counts.  Do this using the
following steps:
<ul>	<li>Write 16*10<sup>6</sup> clk over 1 second
	<li>Multiply this by the number of timer 1 counts per clock
	<li>Multiply this by the number of seconds per milliseconds
	<li>Multiply this by a variable X which represents the number of
	milliseconds in a half period.
</ul>

Please write out the dimensional analysis using the form we used in class and
that used in your lecture notes.
</ol>

Calculate the number of timer 1 counts for each note in your Excel 
spreadsheet using the following instructions:
<ul>	<li>In cell F1 of your excel spreadsheet add "TMR1 cnts"
	<li>In cell F2 enter the formula you derived in the previous
	question.  You should have something like "=E2*?", where "?" is
	a numerical value.
	<li>Select cell F2, click and drag the small green square in the 
	lower right corner of cell F2 down to cell F33. This will reproduce 
	the formula that you typed in cell F2 with a relative replacement 
	of "E2".
</ul>

<ol start=13>
<li>Export the completed spreadsheet as a PDF as the solution to this
question.  To accomplish this, complete the following steps.<br>
From Excel:  File &rarr; Export &rarr; Create PDF/XPS Document.
Save the file in your lab03 directory.
In Word: Insert &rarr; Object &rarr; Adobe Acrobat Document<br>
Don't forget the last question below.

<li>Modify the program so that it plays the notes from any of the popular
<a href="http://www.choose-piano-lessons.com/kids-songs.html">Kids songs</a>
using the noted from the table above.  Demo the application to the
