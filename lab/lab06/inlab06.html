Lab 6 - In-lab activities</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions. Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to familiarize you with the serial packets
sent from an IR remote control unit.

<h2>Note</h2>
The gesture recognition hardware present in some cell-phones will 
emit bursts of IR radiation, appearing as spurious IR data packets in
our environment.  This can be very frustrating to achieving the objectives
of your and your neighbors lab.  So please take a moment to put your cell 
phone in an enclosed space like a backpack or pocket during the duration
of the lab.

<h2>External Hardware</h2>
We will be working with the remote control decoder to understand the 
messages coming from a remote control unit and converting them into
binary sequences.  In order to do this you must first be familiar with 

<h3>Remote control decoder</h3>
To start, you you must be familiar with the operation of the Vishay 
Infrared Receiver 
<br><img src="./img/TSOP34.jpg"><br><br>

<ol>
<li>Go to the Bill of Materials spreadsheet linked in the in-lab activities 
associated with Lab 01.  Use the DigiKey part number for the 38kHz 
remote control decoder to find the part on Digikey website.  What is the
manufacture part number? Download the technical documents at the Datasheets
link.
<li>Using the technical documents and the model number of our remote control
decoder, what is the carrier frequency of our part?
<li>What wavelength of light(nm) is the remote control decoder most 
sensitive to?  What figure did you consult to determine this answer?
<li>Look at the development board layout, what I/O pin on the PIC is the 
V<sub>out</sub> pin from the IR decoder connected to?
</ol>


<h3>IR LED</h3>
In order to communicate to an remote control decoder like the one we have
on our development board, we need a LED that transmits photons at the 
wavelength
corresponding to the maximum relative spectral sensitivity given in the 
remote control decoders technical documents.  In the Bill of Materials 
used in the previous question, find the Digikey part number for the "IR LED"
and get the technical documents.
<ol start=5>
<li>What is the peak emitted wavelength of this LED?  Hint, you can find this 
in the graph showing "Relative Spectral Emission".
<li>What is the Relative Radiant Intensity of light emitted by the LED 
when viewed 10&deg; off center?  Note, both sides of the Radiation
Characteristics graph show the same information, they just present it 
in different ways.
<li>We will be running this IR LED at 10% duty cycle at 38kHz at room
temperature.  Use this information to determine the following values 
in the "Permissible Pulse Handling Capability" graph:
<ul>	<li>T (state your answer in &micro;s)
	<li>t<sub>p</sub> (state your answer in (&micro;s)
	<li>D (state your answer as a decimal, NOT as a percentage)
	<li>I<sub>F</sub> (provide a bound, like "greater than", on the 
	answer because our value is off the graph).
</ul>
</ol>


<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
In order to build an IR communication system our PIC microcontroller
will need to control the IR LED using a PWM waveform that turns on and off
at 38kHz.  The data sent out by the IR LED will be received by the IR 
decoder module that will convert it into a sequence of 0 and 1's.  These
bits will be sent to EUSART2 which will convert these bits into bytes.  
Let's look a little closer at each of these subsystems to better understand
their capabilities and how they will be configured in our program.
<br><br>

<b>PWM</b><br>
Today's code uses a CCP subsystem in PWM mode to pulse the IR LED at 
38kHz.  The CCP subsystem uses TMR2 to establish the period of the PWM 
waveform.   Your code will change the duty cycle of the PWM waveform
using a MCC call.

<ol start=8>

<li>Look at the schematic of the development board posted on the
class home page.  What pin of the PIC drives the network of electrical
components associated with the LED labeled "INFRARED"?  What CCP 
CCP subsystem is associated with this pin?

<li>Complete the following table by computing the maximum period of
TMR2 with the given prescaler.  Remember that "maximum period" means
the amount of time TMR2 would need to count from 0 all the way back 
to 0.  You may want to consult Chapter 13 of the PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 
Data Sheet if you have questions about how TMR2 operates.


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>TMR2 Prescaler	<td>Maximum Period
<tr><td>1:1		<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>1:4		<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>1:16		<td>&nbsp;
</table>

<li>Compute the period of a 38kHz waveform.  What is the smallest
TMR2 prescaler that has a maximum period greater than 38kHz? 

<li>Look through the inLab06 code (linked below) and identify the MCC
function which sets the duty cycle of the CCP subsystem associated 
with the IR LED.
</ol>


<b>EUSART</b><br>
Let's start our examination of the EUSART2 subsystem by first
looking at the schematic of the development board to answer the following
question.

<ol start=12>
<li>What pin of the PIC is the IR decoder (called "GP1UQ70QS") connected
to?

<li>Open up the PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet and go to page 6 (you may
have a handout of this page from an in-class handout) and list the 
pins of the PIC associated with EUSART2 and their names (find this in the
EUSART column).
</ol>

Since the IR decoder pin is not connected to the EUSART2 RX pin, in 
order to have the IR decoder serve as an input device to the EUSART2
module, you will need to connect the IR decoder pin to the EUSART2 RX
pin using a jumper wire that came with your development board.  The
first set of experiments that you will perform with today's example
code will not require this jumper wire, the later experiments will.
<br><Br>

In order to read the bits coming in from the IR decoder you must tell
the PIC EUSART2 subsystem how long each bit is.  The Baud rate is the
number of bits per second sent/received.  For example, a Baud rate
of 1200 means that 1200 bits per second are sent/received.  In this
case, each bit takes 1/1200 of a second or 833 &micro;s.  Since 
today's program both sends and receives bits at the same Baud rate,
we will need to know how to configure the EUSART2 subsystem to change
Baud rate and will need to know how many 1:1 prescaled TMR1 counts 
correspond to each of these Baud rates.

In order to set the Baud rate of the EUSART2 subsystem, the
EUSART2 module divides down the main oscillator, F<sub>osc</sub> by a 
value contained in the Baud Rate Generator (BRG).  In order to switch 
between Baud rates, as you will do in this assignment, you will
need to update the values in the SPBRGH2:SPBRG2 register pair.

<ol start=14>
<li>
The Baud rate of EUSART2 is given by the following formula:
<pre>
			    F<sub>osc</sub>
	Baud rate = ------------------------
		    4 * (SPBRGH2:SPBRG2 + 1)

</pre>
Where F<sub>osc</sub> is the clock speed of the main oscillator
(you set this using the MCC) and SPBRGH2:SPBRG2 is a 16-bit
value (formed from two 8-bit registers), that divides down the main
oscillator.  You can change these two registers at run
time to change the Baud rate.  We will want to change the Baud rate
to experiment and see what the fastest rate we can transmit information.
In order to do this, you will need to complete the following table.
To get the SPBRGH2:SPBRG2 values, solve the equation above for 
SPBRGH2:SPBRG2 and then plug in values to determine a decimal
value.  Convert this decimal value into hexadecimal then assign the least 2 
significant hex digits to SPBRG2 and the two most significant hex digits 
to SPBRGH2 (pad with 0 if there are not enough digits).
<br><br>

For example, with a target Baud rate of 1200 bits per second and the default
oscillator speed, SPBRGH2:SPBRG2 = 13,332.  Converting this to hex yields
SPBRGH2:SPBRG2 = 0x3414.  Assigning the lower two hex digits to 
SPBRG2 = 0x14 and the upper two hex digits SPBRGH2 = 0x34.
<br><Br>

In the "Bit Period (us)" column, put the duration of one bit period at
the Baud rate given in that row.  In the "Bit Period (1:1 prescaled TMR1
counts) column, convert microseconds into 1:1 prescaled TMR1 counts.  
The reason for this will be made clear when you examine the code in 
later questions.


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Baud Rate	<td>SPBRGH2	<td>SPBRG2	<td>Bit Period (us)
	<Td>Bit Period (1:1 prescaled TMR1 counts)
<tr><td>300	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>1200	<td>0x34	<td>0x14	<td>833us	<td>13333
<tr><td>2400	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>4800	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>9600	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>19200	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;	<td>&nbsp;
</table>
</li>

The PWM subsystem needs to generate a 38kHz waveform with a 0% or 10% 
duty cycle through pin RC1.  Our program will manipulate pin RC1 using
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) through the ECCP2 subsystem.

<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
The IR LED on our PIC draws a tremendous amount of current and, as a 
consequence, generates a very bright pulse of light.  However, since
that light is infrared, we cannot see it.  But don't be fooled, it's
very bright.  Let's do some basic experiments to see just how much 
current flows through the IR LED and how the light from the IR LED
interacts with the IR decoder. 

In order to answer some of the following questions, please refer to 
this annotate version of the IR LED driver circuit that you can
find in the development board schematic.

<br><img src="./img/IRcurrent.bmp"><br><br>

In this transistor circuit the IR LED and resistor currents are almost
the same.  In other words we will assume that I<sub>LED</sub> = I<sub>r</sub>.
Hence, the resistor current is a good proxy for the LED current.  We 
can infer the resistor current by measuring the voltage drop across 
the resistor and then use Ohm's law to determine the current (because
we know the resistance of R10 is 2.2&ohm;).
<br><Br>

In order to measure the voltage drop across R10, setup your oscilloscope
as follows:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Baud Rate		<td>1200
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>Left side of R10
<tr><td>Ch2 probe		<td>RC1
<tr><td>Ch2 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>200&micro;s
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>0.5V
<tr><td>Ch2 (scale) 		<td>1V
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Normal
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>2
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&darr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.65V
</table>

You will want to remove the probe tip gripper and reveal the sharp tip of
the oscilloscope probe to do this.  You can remove the Ch1 ground clip
to make manipulation of the probe tip easier.

<ol start=15>
<li>Measure the voltage on the high-side of the 2.2&ohm; resistor R10
using the oscilloscope by probing the left side of resistor R10 as
shown in the image below.  Use the 'p' function in PuTTy to produce 
the IR pulses.
<br><img src="./img/probeResistor.bmp"><br><br>

<li>From this oscilloscope screen shot, what is the voltage drop
across resistor when the PWM waveform is at logic 1?  You measured this
voltage at the "Probe here" location in the image above.  Use Ohm's law 
to compute how much current flows through the IR LED during this brief 
interval?  Round your answer to 2 significant figures.

<li>If you accidentally placed a steady logic 1 on RC1 (with the
IR_TX jumper installed), the huge current drawn by the IR LED will 
cause the Vcc voltage to drop.  Let's test this by applying a steady
logic 1 to the IR amplifier 
<ul>	<li>Remove the IR_TX jumper
	<li>Place one end of a jumper wire to the Vcc pin,
	<li>Briefly place the other end of this jumper wire to the 
	<u>right</u> pin of the IR_TX jumper,
	<li>Record, as your answer to this question, what you observed
	happen to the green Power-On LED.
</ul>

</ol>

<b><u>Replace the IR_TX jumper before proceeding with the lab</u></b>

The IR radiation being emitted by the IR LED is very bright indeed.
So bright, in fact, that it has no problem bouncing around the walls
of the lab and entering the into the IR decoder connected to pin RC0.
To see this, let's use the 'p' function to emit a burst or IR pulses
and look at the effect they have on the IR decoder output.  Configure
your oscilloscope as follows:
<br><br>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Baud Rate		<td>1200
<tr><td>Ch1 probe               <td>RC0
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale)             <td>2V
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip         <td>Development board ground loop
<tr><td>Ch2 probe               <td>RC1
<tr><td>Ch2 (scale)             <td>2V
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale)      <td>200 us
<tr><td>Trigger mode            <td>Normal
<tr><td>Trigger source          <td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope           <td>&darr;
<tr><td>Trigger level           <td>1.65V
</table>


<ol start=18>

<li>Replace the "grabber" to the Ch1 oscilloscope probe and connect Ch1
to pin RC0.  Capture a screen shot of the 'p' function output as your
answer to this question.


<li>How long does it take, from the start of the IR pulses on RC1,
for the output of the IR decoder (shown on RC0) to go to logic 0?
How long does it take, from the end of the IR pulses on RC1,
for the output of the IR decoder (shown on RC0) to return to logic 1?
</ol>

This ability to detect your own radiated IR pulses will allow you to
complete the lab by yourself using a single development board.  Of
course, you can run this code on two different development boards and
transfer data from one to another.   You are welcome to experiment with
this idea, but may I suggest finishing answering the questions in this
in-lab first.
<br><Br>


We will be using a non-standard data format for our IR data 
packets - ASCII.  When you press the 'S' key to transmit a character,
the IR LED will blink at 38KHz.  When the IR decoder "sees" this,
it's output will go to logic 0.a  The 'S' function times the IR LED
blinking so that the IR decoder output generates an acceptable looking
serial ASCII character. 
Before using an oscilloscope to examine the signals, I'd like you to 
look at the code first and predict what you should see on the oscilloscope
(and then use an oscilloscope to check your assumptions).
Open up the inLab06 code and find the code associated with the 'S'
key.  Use this section of code to answer the following questions.
<br><Br>

<ol start=20>
<li>
Each bit of the the variable "letter" is held for some duration of
time using a TMR1 delay loop.
Using the default value for the baudRateSelected variable and the
configuration for TMR1, what is the length of the delay for the code 
snippet?  What Baud rate does this correspond to?
<pre>
	TMR1_WriteTimer(0x10000 - bitPeriod[baudRateSelected]);
	PIR1bits.TMR1IF = 0;
	while (TMR1_HasOverflowed() == false);
</pre>
</li>

The instruction EPWM2_LoadDutyValue(LED_ON); makes the IR LED to oscillate
at 38kHz causing the IR decoder to output a logic 0. The instruction 
EPWM2_LoadDutyValue(LED_OFF); stops the IR LED from emitting IR radiation
causing the IR decoder to output logic 1.

<li>Let the variable "letter" equal ASCII '5'.  Use the code in the "S" 
function to trace out the activity that this IR LED would cause on the 
output of the IR decoder.  Note, the S function transmits 10-bits of data - 
make sure to include all of them in your answer.  The space between a pair of 
vertical dotted lines denotes 1 bitPeriod, the duration of which you found
in the previous problem.  Label the time axis at each of the vertical lines
with the the time in milliseconds (to 2 significant digits).
<br><img src="./img/bitSequence.bmp">
</ol>


Let's capture an IR packet and include it in your lab report.  To
do this configure your oscilloscope as follows:

Finally, let's get the oscilloscope to convert this stream of bits
into an ASCII character using the following oscilloscope setup.

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule on the upper half 
	of the oscilloscope screen.
	<li>Convert serial stream<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Mode</u> &rarr; UART/RS232<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Serial</u> &rarr; Serial 1: UART/RS232 &check;<br>

	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>
	[&uarr;Back]
	<li>Screen shot the screen on USB:<br>

	<u>24-bit Bit... (*.bmp)</u>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Press to Save</u>
</ul>

Press the "S" and You should see the flicker of 
bits being sent and then a short time later they will go away.  In order to 
get the bits to stay on the screen you need to switch the oscilloscope 
trigger from auto to normal mode. [Mode/Coupling] &rarr; Mode &rarr; Normal 
<br><br>



<ol start=22>
<li>Screen capture a transmitted character "5".

<li>In main.c, find the code under "case 'b':"  and set the
correct values for the SPBRGH2:SPBRGH registers using the values
you found in a previous inLab question.  Cut and paste your code for
"case '0':" through "case '4':" as your answer to this question.

<li>In main.c, find the values for the bitPeriod array at the 
top of main.  Set the correct values for the delays using the values
you found in a previous inLab question.  Cut and paste your code 
the correct initialized values as your answer to this question.
</ol>

Now that you have verified that you are able to transmit a nice
ASCII character, its time to have the PIC interpret them.  In order
to do this you will need to place a jumper wire between RC0 and RB7.
<u>Only place the jumper wire between RC0 and RB7 after you have
unplugged the programmer (PICKit 3, PICKIT4, or SNAP)</u>.  Any 
time you need to reprogram the PIC, you will need to remove this 
jumper wire as the output from the IR decoder attached to RB7 (via RC0) 
will interfere with the programmer that uses RB7 as the PGD pin
to the PIC.

<ol start=25>

<li>Experiment with the Baud rate using the "b" function.  What is the
fastest, reliable, Baud rate?

<li>Explain what device is limiting the Baud rate, and how you 
figured this out.  Hint, discuss the relationship between the 
IR pulses on RC1 and the incoming data on RC0 that you investigated 
in questions 18 and 19.
</ol>

The following is paraphrased from page 264 of the PIC18....
<pre>
When all bits of the character have been shifted in, they are immediately transferred to a two character First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory. The FIFO buffering allows reception of two complete characters and the start of a third character before software must start servicing the EUSART receiver.  Access to the received data is via the RCREG2 register.
</pre>

This means that when you read RCREG2, you may not be reading the
most recent character received, but rather something older.
To prevent this causing problems, I read the RCREG2 twice at
the beginning of main.  

<ol start=27>
<li>Where in main, at start-up, is the contents of RCREG2 register
cleared?  State your answer in terms of code line numbers.  Hint,
I clear the register twice in order to make sure the FIFO is empty.

In this weeks lab you will write an ISR to service EUSART2 interrupt.
In order to understand how data is collected, how interrupt flag
is set and how that interrupt flag is cleared, you will need to 
read and understand the material in section 16.1.2 of the 
PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet posted on the class web page. 

<li>Use the content of the data sheet to help answer the following question.
In particular the introduction to section 16.1.2, section 16.1.2.2 and 
sections 16.1.2.4.
<ul>	<li>What does FIFO stand for?
	<li>How many complete characters can be stored in the FIFO?
	<li>What register would you read to remove characters from the
	EUSART2 FIFO?
	<li>Assume that the RSR received the character 'a' and then 
	latter receive the character 'b'.  What character would you
	expect when you read the register in the previous question?
	What character would you get on the second read?  Hint, think
	about the meaning of FIFO.
	<li>What flag is set when a character is received?  Include the
	name of the register and name of the field.
	<li>When will this flag be set?  Hint, section 16.1.2.4.  
	<li>Can your program clear this flag by writing 0 to it?
	<li>How does your program clear this flag?
<ul>

</ol>
