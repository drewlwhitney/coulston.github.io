<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and
perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet
items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them
in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions
posted there.
<br><Br>

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions.
Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer
to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope
trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of
art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless
it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to introduce you to the MPLAB Code
Configurator (MCC) and how to use timers to generate delays.

<h2>External Hardware</h2>
Today you will write code that you can interact with through the terminal
(input) and generate musical tones through the speaker (output) using
timers. Let's start by looking at the speaker and the hardware that will
drive it. Start by searching the Internet for the technical documents for the
1" Mallory PSR-28N08A-JQ speaker. Go to http://www.mallory-sonalert.com
and search for the product number of the speaker. We will need to use the
frequency response graph for the following questions.

<ol start=1>
<li>Using the Frequency Response graph in the technical documents, at
what frequency does the speaker produce the loudest sound and what is
the magnitude of this sound (include units)?</li>

<li>A person with good hearing should be able to detect sounds with a
volume level of 70db. What is the lowest frequency, for our speaker,
that has this volume level?</li>
</ol>

The I/O pins on the PIC microcontroller are not capable of supplying
enough current to adequately drive the speaker. Fortunately you soldered
a National Semiconductors LM4862 Boomer Audio Power Amplifier to the
development board. You will need to run a jumper wire from the pin generating
the audio signal to the low pass filter (LPF) input and then from the LPF
output to the LM4862 input.  The LPF is needed to "soften" out the
hard audio edges created by the PIC, consequently reducing the voltage
drop induced by the power drain of the audio amplifier. This will help
prevent the development board from resetting due to a brown-out.

<ol start=3>
<li>Pull the technical documents for the LM4862 (audio amp) by looking
up its part number from the bill of materials linked in inlab01.
On page 1 of the technical documents, Figure 1 shows a typical audio
amplifier application. Which pin number and pin name is connected to
the audio input through a series RC circuit?</li>

<li>Look over the schematic and layout of the development board and identify
the silk screened identifier next to the header pin that is connected to
the audio input pin of the LM4862. Hint: Follow the connection from the
LM4862 pin past the series RC circuit. See the image below if you still
need help.

<img src="./img/LM4862.bmp"><br><br>
</ol>


Today's program will utilize a terminal interface to the program. A
terminal interface provides a much more flexible method to interact
with the PIC. We will investigate the hardware that makes this possible
in next week's lab. However there are some basics that you must
understand to use the terminal.
<br><br>

When you plug your development board into a PC you may have noticed that
your
PC makes a chime sound. This chime tells you that the PC has recognized your
development board and assigned it a COM port. A PC may have any number of COM
ports, so each is given a unique numerical value. There are a variety
of different ways to determine the COM port assigned to your FT230 chip,
but I find the easiest to run
<a href="../../COMSniffer.exe">Brandon's COM port finder</a>. There is
also a link to this application on the class main page. When your board
is connected to a PC through a USB cable, running COMSniffer should
produce output similar to the following; in this case my development
board was assigned COM3. Note that more than likely your PC will
assign your development board a different port number. You will need
the port number anytime you need to connect your PIC to a terminal
application like PuTTY.

<br><img src="./img/COMSniffer.bmp"><br><br>



<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
We will hold off exploring the
The Enhanced Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
(EUSART) subsystem of the PIC until next week's lab. Instead we will
focus on the big idea in today's lab, interrupts.
<br><br>

The internal configuration bits for the PIC are contained in the special
function registers (SFR). You can manipulate the values of the bits in
these registers in your C programs by concatenating the register NAME
with the FIELD name in the format
<font face=courier>NAMEbits.FIELD = value;</font>, the expression
"bits" needs to be appended to the register NAME and the "." separates the
NAME and FIELD. Let's look at a practical example;  open the Microchips
PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet to page 166. Let's say that you wanted to
enable timer 1 by setting the TMR1ON field of the T1CON register. In
your C code you would add the line
<font face=courier>T1CONbits.TMR1ON = 1;</font>


<ol start=5>
<li>To enable Timer 1 to run off Fosc/4 mode using a 1:1 prescaler, how
do we need to configure the following T1CON bits?
<ul>	<li>T1CONbits.TMR1ON =
	<li>T1CONbits.TMR1CS =
	<li>T1CONbits.T1CKPS =
</ul>

</ol>

<h2>Firmware Organization</h2>
A microcontroller by itself is not terribly interesting, being not much more
than a slow-running processor. Microcontrollers derive their power from
the subsystems they contain and the external devices these subsystems can
control. In order to be able to interface to as many different external
devices as possible, the computer engineers who design microcontollers make
the subsystems as flexible as possible. This means that there are potentially
a great number of alternative configurations for each subsystem. When
developing an embedded application that interfaces microcontroller subsystem
to an external device, one of the first tasks you must complete is configuring
the subsystem. <br><br>

In my experience, subsystem configuration is a necessary task that can
turn into a time consuming and potentially-frustrating challenge.
Thankfully, the folks at Microchips
developed the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) to address this challenge.
Paraphrasing the text in the MPLAB® Code Configurator User’s Guide,
MCC is a plug-in tool in MPLAB X which generates drivers (software) for
controlling and driving subsystems based on the settings and selections
made in the Graphical User Interface. The generated drivers can be used
in your program.

<h3>Create new project</h3>
The first step to using MCC is to create a new project
and launch MCC as described in the steps below.

<ul>
<li>Launch MPLab X
<li>Close any open project: File &rarr; Close All Projects
<li>Create a new inLab04 project as you did in Lab 2. Make sure, at
step 2 (Select Device), to choose PICKit 3 or 4.
<li>Click  Tools &rarr; Embedded &rarr; MPLab Code Configurator
<li>If the MPLab Code Configurator is not listed then you will need
to install the Code Configurator as follows:
<ul>	<li>Tools &rarr; Plugins
	<li>In the Plugins pop-up select the "Available Plugins" tab
	<li>Check the "MPLab Code Configurator" check box
	<li>Click Install
</ul>
</ul>



<h3>Configure the PIC with MCC</h3>
You should use MCC for the remainder of the term for all future projects.
Every project in this class will require you to configure the oscillator
and I/O pins. In addition to these two subsystems, you will also configure
the timer subsystem in the steps below.

<ul>
<li>Click on "Clock Control" in the Project Resources section of the Resource
Management tab (left side of the screen). Then, in the Clock Control tab
<ul>	<li>System Clock Select: FOSC
	<li>Internal Clock: 16MHz_HFINTOSC
	<li>Software PLL Enabled: &check;
</ul>
The current System Clock should be 64000000.

<li>Click on "Pins" in Project Resources. In the Pins Grid View tab
(bottom of the screen)
click on the open lock in the PortB 5 column and in the output row.
The blue background color should switch to green, meaning that RB5
is now an output. The open lock immediately below should change its
background color to orange meaning that RB5 is not an input.
<li>Open the Pins tab (right side of the screen).
Click on the Custom Name text box in the RB5 row and change
the name of RB5 to "SPEAKER_PIN"
<li>Make pin RA6 an output called "TEST_PIN"

<li>In the Device Resources section of the Resource Management tab, scroll down
and expand the "Timer" list. Double click TMR1. A TMR1 tab will open on the
right side of the screen. In this tab, make sure the following items
are selected (leave the other defaults alone),
<ul>	<li>Timer Enable:	&check;
	<li>Clock Source:	FOSC/4
	<li>Prescaler:		1:1
	<li>TMR Interrupt Enable:	&check;
</ul>

<li>In the Device Resources section of the Resource Management tab, scroll down
and expand the "UART" list. Double click UART. In the UART tab,
<ul>	<li>UART PLIB Selector:	EUSART1
	<li>Requested Baudrate:		9600
	<li>Data Size:	8
	<li>Flow Control Mode:	None
	<li>Redirect Printf to UART:	&check;
	<li>Interrupt Driven:	&square;
</ul>

<li>Click on the "Generate" button in the Project Resources section of the
Resource Management tab. If you select the Output &rarr; MPLAB Code
Configurator tab, you can keep an eye on what files MCC is generating and
updating. Note that anytime that you make a change to the configuration
using MCC, you need to save and re-generate the supporting files exported
into your project.

<li>Click the project tab in the project manager area. Expand the
"Source File" folder.
<li>Double click the file main.c to open it in the editor window.
<li>Replace the contents of main.c with
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="./code/inlab04Classic.c">inlab04Classic.c</a></li>
	<li> <a href="./code/inlab04Melody.c">inlab04Melody.c</a></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

Before downloading and running the inlab04.c program, take a moment to
look at the structure of the files created by MCC and the utility functions
and definitions contained in them. In the project manager window expand
Header and Source Files &rarr; MCC Generated Files.
Double click and open all the files in these folder. Use the contents of
the files to answer the following questions.

<ol start=6>
<li>What two EUSART1.c functions are being used just inside the infinte
loop in main?
</li>
<br>

When the TMR1 interrupt occurs, the INTERRUPT_InterruptManager function
(you can find it in the MCC Generated File interrupt.c)
is invoked by the PIC. Find the INTERRUPT_InterruptManager function and
name the function that it calls. Call this the daughter function
of INTERRUPT_InterruptManager.

To find the granddaughter function of the INTERRUPT_InterruptManager
function look at the code associated with the daughter function of the
INTERRUPT_InterruptManager function. <i>When you are looking
for a MCC function, the first word of the function is the name of its
MCC Generated File.</i>

This code in the daughter function looks like it calls
TMR1_OverflowCallback(), but this "function" is really a function pointer.
A function pointer is variable that can be assigned to a function.
In our case the TMR1_OverflowCallbackRegister function performs this
assignment by taking in as an argument, the function you would like to
serve as the interrupt service routine for TMR1.
<li>In what two functions is the TMR1_OverflowCallback function pointer changed?

<li>After TMR1_OverflowCallbackRegister is called in your program, which
function (also in your program) will TMR1_OverflowCallback point to?

<li>
When answering the following questions, focus on the interrupt handler
not calls to the CounterSet function.
<ul>
<li>What is the daughter function of INTERRUPT_InterruptManager?
<li>What is the granddaughter function of INTERRUPT_InterruptManager?
</ul>
</li>

<li>What does the granddaughter function do to TMR1IF and to the value
of TMR1?
<li>Where is the variable timer1ReloadVal given a value?  What is
this value?  Note the initial value is set by MCC in the Timer Period
field in the TMR1 Easy Setup window.
</li>
</ol>

Look at the myTMR1ISR function (defined in main.c) to
answer the following questions.

<ol start=12>
<li>What is the first and last thing that happen in this function?
Ignore variable declarations.

<li> A flag is a variable (usually typed uint8_t) that equals either true
or false. What three flags are checked in this function?  Briefly explain
what each flag does.

<li>What behavior would you expect if you removed the incNote=false;
statement from the function. Hint, consider what would happen if
playNote was true (a note is being played) and the user typed "i"
in at the terminal. Heck, give it a try (by commenting out the
statement) if you want to check your answer.
</ol>


<h2>Firmware Operation</h2>
Your next step will be to download, run and observe the behavior of
the inlab04.c program. MCC does not require you to change the process
you used in lab02; so the following steps should be familiar.

<ul>
<li>Connect the development board to a USB port on the PC,
<li>Connect the PICKit 3 or 4 to a USB port on the PC,
<li>Connect the PICKit 3 or 4 to the development board so that the triangle
on the PICKit 3 or 4 and the development board align,
<li>In the toolbar click on the Clean and Build Project icon (hammer and
broom). If you get an error, it most likely a result of naming the
buttons differently than I described above. Either fix the name of the
pins in the code configurator (and re-generate) or modify the names of
the pins in the inLab04 code,
<li>In the toolbar click on the Run Project icon (green arrow pointing right),
<li>Check the "Do not show this message again" checkbox in the
MPLab pop-up and then click OK,
<li>Three things will now happen that should alert you that the download
is in progress:
<ul>    <li>Text will scroll by in the PICKit 3 or 4 tab of the console
ending with
        <font face="courier">Programming/Verify complete</font>,
        <li>The lower right corner of the MPLab X window you should see
        "inLab04 (Build, Load)" with a progress bar flashing,
        <li>The lights on the PICKit 3 or 4 will be flashing.
</ul>
<li>Connect a jumper wire between RB5 and LPFin.
<li>Add a jumper between LPFout and AMPin.
<li>Add a jumper between the 5V header next to the USB onnector.
<li>Determine which COM port the PC has assigned to your development board.
<li>Launch PuTTY.
<ul>	<li>Connection type = Serial
	<li>Serial line  COMx - where "x": is the numeric code assigned
	to your development board.
	<li>Click Open
</ul>
<li>Type "?" to see the menu of options. Play around and make some music.
Interrupts allow you to hear the notes being played while still allowing
you to interact with the terminal. Neat (and very useful) trick.
</ul>


<h3>Observe output</h3>
One of the primary reasons electrical engineers use oscilloscopes is to
observe phenomena that are too fast and too small to be observed directly
with something like a digital multimeter. In the following steps, you
will use the oscilloscope to observe the signal generated on TEST_PIN while
your program is inside the ISR. Make sure that a note is <u>not</u> playing
when you capture this waveform. To do this setup your oscilloscope as follows:
<br><br>


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>RA6
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>500ns
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>1V
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&uarr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.5V
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>
	[&uarr;Back]
	<li>Screen shot the screen on USB:<br>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Format</u> &rarr;
	<u>24-bit Bit... (*.bmp)</u>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Press to Save</u>
	<li>If the image looks dim, try pressing the Run/Stop button
	to snap a picture of the waveform. When the Run/Stop button is
	illuminated red, the waveform is frozen and should look brighter.
	Make sure to press Run/Stop so that its illuminated green to
	enable the oscilloscope to capture new waveforms.
</ul>

<ol start=15>
<li>Include the screenshot from the waveform save on your oscilloscope. Use
a thumb drive to capture the image and paste it into your lab report - credit
will not be given to cell phone pictures. Please do not submit them.

<li>Using the time per division information on the oscilloscope screen and
the time high duration the waveform (described in divisions), show your
calculation for the time high duration of the waveform on RA6 using an
approach like:
<pre>
Oscilloscope set to 10us/division
The duration of the RA6 pulse is 0.6 divisions

	 10us
	-------- *  0.6 divisions = 6us
	division
</pre>

<li>Using the horizontal scale adjust and horizontal position adjust,
zoom in on the positive edge (from 0V to 3.3V) of the signal being
generated by the TEST_PIN to determine the rise time of the signal.
The rise time is defined as the time to transition from 10% of the
final value (0.33V) to 90% of the final value (2.97V). You may find
increasing the vertical scale also helps.
Be careful if you decide to use the oscilloscope’s built in rise time
measurement instead of the cursors. You’ll want to make sure that
you’re set up to do a 10% to 90% rise time. You need to include an
oscilloscope screen shot that shows information necessary to backup
your answer.

<li>Using the rise time from the previous problem, determine the slew
rate of the PIC output. The slew rate of a signal transition is the
change in voltage divided by the time that change takes. Slew rate
has units of Volts per microsecond. In our case, this is the change in
voltage divided by the rise time. Make sure you state your answer
in volts per microsecond.
</ol>




<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
Keep the oscilloscope connected to TEST_PIN while answering the
following questions. You may need to make adjustments to the
horizontal scale and position in order to see and measure the
values asked for.

<ol start=19>
<li>Compare the time spent inside the ISR when the PIC is and is not playing
a note.
<li>The TMR1_CounterSet function is largely responsible for this increased
execution time. How long does it takes the PIC to execute this line
of code?
<li>When the playNote flag is true, the if/then associated with this flag
is executed and TMR1 gets initialized to the half period of the note
being played. However, then the playNote flag is false, TMR1 is not
initialized by the ISR. Use the MCC generated code and the oscilloscope
to determine the initial count value of TMR1 when playNote == false?
Hint: Zoom out and look at the time between positive pulses on the
oscilloscope. Does that number look familiar?
</ol>

One principle of embedded programming is to minimize the time spent
inside an ISR.  The purpose of this principle is to ensure that the
ISR completes its execution before it is invoked again.
Printing characters to the terminal is always a time consuming operation;
at 9600 Baud (Baud has units of bits per second) it takes 833&micro;s to
print a single character.

<ol start=22>
<li>Using the Baud rate information above, how long should it take to
print the string inside the ISR associated with the doSomethingBad
flag?  Make sure to include the carriage return and line feed (each as a
single character) in your calculation. Show your work.
<li>Use the "t" function to measure the actual time it takes to print
this string.
<li>Press the "b" key to set the doSomethingBad flag true. What happened?
Note: You will have to short out the reset pads of your development
board to break out of this bad behavior. The reset pads are labeled
"RST" and are near the programming pins of your board (AKA: near the
white triangle).
<li>Explain what happened. Your answer should comment on the relative
time required to print the message and the interrupt frequency.
</ol>

When writing embedded program, one of my most common errors is to forget
to include:
<pre>
    INTERRUPT_GlobalInterruptEnable();      // ISR not working? - you probably
    INTERRUPT_PeripheralInterruptEnable();  // forgot to add these 2 lines
</pre>

You can find these two lines at the top of main.
<ol start=26>
<li>Commenting out these two lines, compile and download the resulting code.
What functionality works and what functionality of your program no longer
works?
</ol>
