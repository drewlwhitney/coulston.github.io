Lab 8 - Microphone</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions. Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to gain an understanding of how samples
are recorded from the microphone and examine how aliasing operates
in a sampled system.

<h2>External Hardware</h2>
For this lesson, you will be using the microphone on the development board.
Attached to this microphone is a 1<sup>st</sup> order low pass filter
acting as an antialias filter in front of the RA5 (analog) input to
the PIC 18F26K22. Let's start by investigating the microphone and
filter.

<h3>Electric Mic</h3>
Access the Bill of Materials for the development board from an earlier lab,
find the DigiKey part number for the Electric mic and download its
technical documents from Digikey.

<ol>
<li>In your own words, describe the Frequency Response graph on
page 2 of the technical documents. You may want to
consult the Wiki on<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">
Frequency Response</a>.

<li>What is the relationship between the input and output signals at 0db?

</ol>


<h3>OPA344</h3>
In this section you will examine the low pass filter stage of the
microphone subsystem. The following figure is taken from the schematic
and annotates sections of the filter for further discussion.

<br><img width=600 src="./img/micFrontEnd.bmp"><br><br>

Our op-amp is setup as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Active_electronic_realization">Low Pass Filter</a>.
This op-amp configuration combines gain with a low pass filter. The gain
is required to order to boost the small signal coming from the microphone
into a measurable signal. The low pass filter helps reduce unwanted alias
from folding down into the signal of interest.

<ol start=3>
<li>Use the link above to find the equations associated with our
low pass filter. Calculate the gain of our LPF?
<li>Calculate the corner frequency, f_c, in Hz of our LPF.
<li>You apply a 1v peak-to-peak sine wave with frequency of 33khz,
calculate the amplitude of the output from the LPF.
</ol>

<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
The PIC has an analog to digital converter (ADC) subsystem which takes
an analog input between 0 and 3.3v and converts the analog voltage
into number, called the converted value between 0 and 1023. The conversion
from voltage to number is ratiometric, meaning that the output is directly
proportional to the input. For example, a 1V input to the ADC will
produce a 10-bit output called x in the derivation below.
<pre>
   3.3v   1 v
   ---- = ---      x = 310.3
   1024    x
</pre>

For practical reasons we will keep only 8 of the 10 bits available from
the ADC output. At first glance the hardware organization in the PIC,
shown in the image below, may look pretty intimidating. However, its
not too bad if you split the hardware into four submodules.
<ol>	<li>The left dashed box with lots of "AN" inputs is a multiplexer.
	The multiplexer chooses one of its inputs (based on the CHS<4:0>
	values) and sends it to the output.
	<li>The module labeled 10-Bit ADC is the actual analog to digital
	converter.
	<li>The 10-bit converted value output from the ADC is sent to a
	pair of 8-bit registers called ADRESH:ADRESL. Since 10-bits does
	not fit perfectly inside a 16-bit register (there are 6 unused bits),
	the 10-bit value will either be pushed left or right inside the
	16-bit register. This is called the converted values justification.
	<li>The fourth sub-module is the pair of dashed boxes with
	PVCFG&lt;1:0&gt; and NVCFG&lt;1:0&gt; as input. This pair of
	multiplexers selects the positive/negative reference voltages used
	by the ADC.
</ol>


<br><img src="./img/adcPicHardware.bmp"><br><br>

Let's examine the signals that are associated with each of the ADC inputs
in the following question.


<ol start=6>
<li>Complete the table below by looking up the relationship between the
ADC channels and the I/O pins using the pin summary on page 6 of the
PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet posted on the class web page. Use the
schematic and layout, posted on the class web page, to determine if
there are any devices attached to each of the I/O pins. Provide the
identity of the device or write "Free" if there is no device. An easy
way to determine this is to look at the pin-header array surrounding
the PIC on the development board
 layout. If there is no wire (red/blue trace) leaving
the header, then that I/O pin is not connected to any device and is free.
If an ADC channel does not have an associated pin, write "None" in the
I/O pin column and "N/A" in the Attached Device column.

<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
Capture a waveform of a whistle  using the following procedure:


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>RA5
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>1 ms
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>1V
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&uarr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.5V
</table>

Now whistle near the microphone and you should see a sine-wave
that goes away when you stop whistling. In order to hold the whistle on
the display of the oscilloscope, you need to switch the oscilloscope
trigger from auto to normal mode using
[Mode/Coupling] &rarr; <u>Mode</u> &rarr; Normal </font><br>

If the lab is noisy, the oscilloscope may retrigger on some background
noise. In order to prevent this try using the "Single" button in the upper
right of the oscilloscope. This will cause the oscilloscope to trigger
once and not record any more information until another run control
button is pressed. Thus you can confidently view the waveform without
having a loud noise in the room retrigger the scope and ruin your
whistle waveform. Make sure to return the oscilloscope back to
Run mode in order to restart signal acquisition.

<tr>	<td width=500><img src="./img/whistle.png"></td>
	<td width=500><img src="./img/fingerSnap.png"></td></tr>
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>

</ul>

<ol start=8>
<li>Capture a whistle waveform, store it on a thumb drive and include
it in your report.

<li>Capture a finger snap waveform. It should look like a damped
sinusoid. Include it in your report.

<li>Whistle three more times in different pitches and record the
frequency you measure on the oscilloscope. Do not whistle directly
into the microphone as the volume will saturate the output.

You are going to use a function generator to provide an input
signal to an analog to digital channel on your PIC. Be careful
otherwise you might damage your PIC. To start, you will want
to make sure that the sine wave that you will be feeding into the
PIC oscillates between 0V to 3.3V. The following image and
instructions will walk you through this process.
<br><img src="./img/functionGeneratorSetup02.jpg"><br><br>

<ol type="A">
</font><li> <font color=red>
Connect a proper signal generator cable to the function generator
yellow BNC connector labeled "CH1",
</font><li> <font color=red>

Press the output1 key if it is not already illuminated.

</font><li><font color=blue>
Connect a proper oscilloscope probe to the channel 1 input of
the oscilloscope. Adjust the vertical scale to 1V/div and the
horizontal scale to 500us, make sure that channel 1 is DC coupled,
and that the trigger level is around 1.65V,
</font><li><font color=blue>
Connect the function generator and oscilloscope cables, black clip
to black clip and red clip to scope probe,
</font><li><font color=blue>
Adjust the scopes so that they display frequency and the peak-to-peak
amplitude of the waveform.

	<li>[&uarr; Back]
</ul>

</font><li><font color=blue>
Confirm that your vertical adjust is 1V/division.
If you don't see anything on the oscilloscope make sure that
the "Output1" button is pressed on the function generator!
</font>
</ol>

Note the items in red are paramount to the safety of your development board.
The setup image shown above, is a properly setup function generator.
If you are uncertain if your function generator is properly setup,
please call for verification,
<br><br>

You are now going to use the function generator to send sin waves with
varying frequencies into the PIC's ADC and have them converted to 8-bit
values at a fixed sampling rate of 10kHz using today's program. You will
then plot the sampled
values in excel. You will then look at this excel plot and infer the
observed frequency of the plotted data - this will be challenging in many
of the cases do your best and note the trends in the data as you infer
the observed frequency. At low frequencies, the input and observed
frequencies will be the same, but at higher frequencies this relationship
will break down, you will discover and observe how this happens.
<br><br>

Start by connecting the development board to the PC through the USB port, run
PuTTY on the PC and interact the terminal application to make sure that
everything is operating correctly. Next connect the function generator,
development board, and oscilloscope
together as shown in the picture below. <u>Make sure that the PC connected
to the development board (and running PuTTY), the oscilloscope and the function
generator are plugged into the same power strip at the rear of the bench!</u>
Preferably in adjacent outlets. Both the oscilloscope and function
generator ground (black) clips need to be connected to the development board
ground - use the ground loops on the development board for an easy setup.
You will need to connect the signal line from the function generator
(red clip) to an free ADC I/O pin that you determined in an earlier question.
You can do this by cutting the end off one of your jumper wires, strip
1cm of insulation off and then tin the resulting stranded end of the wire.
In the image below, this is the red wire connected
to a I/O pin header on the development board and whose tinned end is connected
to both the function generator signal and the oscilloscope probe. When
you first make the connection between the function generator signal line
and the development board, keep an eye on the power LED; if it goes out when
you make the connection, then you have a incorrect connection.
<!--
ground-loop formed by the instrumentation caused by using different
power outlets. Try the following to resolve a ground-loop problem
is this is encountered.
<ul>	<li>Use the benchtop digital multimeter to measure the voltage
	between the oscilloscope ground clip and the function generator
	ground clip. The reading should be in millivolts.
	<li>Use the benchtop digital multimeter to measure the resistance
	between the oscilloscope ground clip and the function generator
	ground clip. The reading should be in milliohms.
	<li>If the readings are not within these guidelines, move around
	the power plugs on the power strip (in adjacent outlets) and
	try again.
</ul>
-->

Once you have this done, you are now ready to do some experimentation.
Start by setting an input frequency using the function generator keypad
and verify the frequency with the oscilloscopes. The
following figures shows my bench setup with an input frequency equal
to 2kHz.
<br><img src="./img/rawScope02.jpg"><br><br>

Use the terminal application to switch the sampled channel to the ANx
pin that you have connected the function generator. Then gather 16
samples from the ADC using the "s" command as shown below.
<br><img src="./img/rawPuTTY.bmp"><br><br>

Cut and paste these samples into the "Magnitude" row (row 2) of the
"rawData" tab of the excel spreadsheet. If all the data appears in a
single cell do the following:
<ul>	<li>Select the cell with the data (B2),
	<li>Data &rarr; Text to Columns,
	<li>In the Convert Text to Columns Wizard select the
		"Delimited" radio button. Select Next,
	<li>In the Delimiters area, select "Space". Select Finish,
	<li>In the pop-up select OK to replace existing content.
</ul>

From this, determine the
observed period of the waveform plotted and enter it into the cell
below "Period" (cell A8). Copy the value from the cell below "observed
Frequency" (cell B8). You will paste this in the alias tab.

<br><img src="./img/rawData.bmp"><br><br>

In the "alias" tab of the excel spreadsheet, paste the observed
frequency into the row corresponding to the input frequency (cell D4).
In order to paste the value of the copied cell and not the formula,
right-click on cell D4 and select the Paste Option corresponding to the
"Values (V)" (the clip board with "123").
<br><img src="./img/rawPlot.bmp"><br><br>

Do this for all the Input Frequencies listed in the alias tab to complete
the graph of Input vs. Input Frequency.

<ol start=11>
<li>Copy and paste your Input vs. Observed Frequency graph for your
answer to this question.
</ol>
