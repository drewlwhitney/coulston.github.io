<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two,
read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions
prescribed.  You do not need to document bullet items.  Make a
record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy
as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.
<Br><Br>

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions.
Use complete English sentences when answering questions.  If the
answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an
oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the
piece of art.  Only include your answers, do not include
the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to familiarize you with the MPLAB X 
development environment so that you can perform simulations with
and without hardware.  This lab will introduce you to two important
tools, the oscilloscope and excel spreadsheets. You will use these
frequently throughout the term.

<h2>External Hardware</h2>
Today you will write code that you can interact with through a button
(input) and an LED (output).  In order to accomplish this you will need
understand how these devices are wired and controlled by the PIC.
<br><Br>

<ol start=1>
<li>Open the schematic for the development board and locate the circuit for the
the push button labeled "TOP".  Determine the voltage (0v or 3.3v) and logic
level (logic 0 or logic 1) that pin RA2 will see for the two possible states 
of the push button listed in the table below.  
<br><Br>

You can verify your answers by connecting the bench digital multimeter (DMM)
to the RA2 header break-out pin on the development board as follows.  
Power-up the DMM by pressing the power-on button on the
lower left of the DMM.  Next plug-in a black cable to the black COM jack on 
the DMM.  Plug-in a red cable to the upper right red jack labeled "V&ohm;Hz".
Press the white "DC V" button on the DMM.  Connect the other end of
the black cable to the ground loop on the development board.  Connect the
other end of the red cable to pin RA2 on the break-out header on the
development board (lower right of the PIC 18F25K22).  Pressing and releasing 
the TOP button should change the value displayed on the DMM.
<br><Br>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Button state	<td>Voltage at RA2	<td>Logic level at RA2
<tr><td>Unpressed	<td>&nbsp		<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>Pressed 	<td>&nbsp		<td>&nbsp
</table>
</li>

We will be illuminating the LED at the bottom of the board by connecting
a jumper wire from RB5 to either the R, G, or B header pin.  In order
to illuminate the LED you will need to assert a logic level on a PIC
pin.  The relationship between the logic level and illumination state
of the LED is investigated in the following question.
<br><br>

<li>Open the schematic for the development board and locate the circuit for the
the RGB LED labeled "SMT_RGBLED".  Determine the voltage (0v or 3.3v) and logic
level (logic 0 or logic 1) that the signal connected to R/G/B need to drive
the LED into one of its two states (illuminated or off).  If you are having 
problems with this, try the experiment described after the table below.
<br><Br>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>LED state	<td>Voltage at R/G/B	<td>Logic level at R/G/B
<tr><td>Illuminated	<td>&nbsp		<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>Off 		<td>&nbsp		<td>&nbsp
</table>

Verify your answers by connecting a R/G/B header pin to a VCC/GND header
pins surrounding the PIC using jumper wire as shown in the photo below.

</ol>



<h2>Firmware Organization</h2>
Since today is the first time that most of you will have used the MPLAB X 
development environment we will first review the basics of how to 
create and simulate your code before diving into how the code 
manipulates the I/O pins of the PIC. 

<h3>Create a MPLab X project</h3>
Start by launching MPLabX on your PC.  Then select File &rarr; New Project.
<ul>
<li>In the New Project pop-up (Step 1: Choose Project)<br>
	Categories: Microchip Embedded<br>
	Project: Application Project(s)<br> <!-- Used to be called Standalone Project -->
	Next&gt;
<li>In the New Project pop-up (Step 2: Select Device)<br>
	Family: Advanced 8-bit MCUs (PIC18)<br>
	Device: PIC18F25K22<br>
	Next&gt;
<li>In the New Project pop-up (Step 3: Select Header)<br>
	Select Tool: <font color=green>&#11044;</font> SNAP<br>
	Next&gt;
<li>In the New Project pop-up (Step 6: Select Compiler)<br>
	Select Compiler: XC8 (latest version)<br>
	Next&gt;
<li>In the New Project pop-up (Step 7: Select Project Name and Folder)<br>
	Project Name: inLab02<br>
	Project Location: hornetDrive\EENG383\labs<br>
	Finish&gt;
<li>In the project manager area of MPLAB X IDE, right mouse click on 
	Source Files and select New &rarr; C main file &hellip;.
	You may need to expand the "inLab02" project to reveal 
	"source files".
<li>In the New C Main File pop-up (Step 2: Name and Location)<br>
	File Name: inLab02.c<br>
	Finish
<li>Open <a href="./code/inlab02.c">inlab02.c</a> and cut-and-paste the
	contents into the inlab02.c tab of the editor area.  Yes,
	you should delete the default template provided by the
	MPLab X IDE.  
</ul>

<ol start=3>
<li>In your own words, what does the "#asm" directive do?  You can find 
information in section 5.12.2 of the MPLAB® XC8 C Compiler User’s Guide.  
A link to this document is posted on the main course web page.
<li>Look-up the NOP instruction on page 388 of the PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22
Data Sheet.  A link to this document is posted on the main course web page.
Describe, in your own words, what this instruction does?
<li>In the inLab02 program, how is LED_PIN defined?  What happen when 
you assign a value to this "variable"?
<li>When line 66, "LED_PIN^=1;" is executes, what behavior do 
you expect to see from the LED?
<li>Select the Classes tab in the Project Manager window.  Expand the
inLab02 selection, then the Libraries selection and then the 
Microchip\xc8\v1.38\include selection.  Scroll down and double click on 
PORTA (NOT PORTAbits_t).  Click Yes on the pop-up warning.  Record the 
assembly language definition for PORTA (a couple of lines below the 
"#define PORTA PORTA" statement - it's the stuff inside the quoted 
asm statement).  Note "equ" stands for equate and is just like a #define.
<li>Look at section 5.4.4. on page 77,78 of the "Microchip PIC18F25K22 Data 
Sheet". From the 
information on these pages interpret the meaning of the PORTA definition. 
Note when the technical documents describe a hexadecimal number they place 
the letter "h" after the numerical value.  In order to solve this problem
you will need to reference your answer to problem 7.
</ol>

<h2>Firmware Operation</h2>
This program is designed to blink the LED 
attached to RB5 at 500Hz when the TOP button on the 
development board is pressed.  Its important to note that in order 
to blink an LED on and off at 500Hz, the LED pin must be toggled 
1000 times a second (or once every 1ms).  This point will be 
important in the development of the code.  <br><br>

Before you start the following task, connect pin RB5 to one of the
RGB header pins using a jumper wire.


<h3>Debugging code on the development board</h3>
There are times when you are having difficulty understanding what
your program is doing that it will be handy to be able to single 
step through your code.  Since we want the PIC 18F25K22 to be under the
control of the MPLab X IDE, we need to the two connected via the 
PICkit 3.  For this reason, <u>when debugging your code through the 
MPLab X IDE, you must keep the PICkit 3 connected to the development board.</u>
While working through the following instructions if you find the 
instructions unclear, try consulting the figure below for some useful
terms.

<ul>
<li>Connect the development board to a USB port on the PC.
<li>Connect the SNAP to a USB port on the PC.
<li>Connect the SNAP to the development board so that the white triangle
on the SNAP and the development board align. 

<li>In project management window right mouse click on project name (inLab02) 
and select Properties.  In the Project Properties pop-up select "Conf" 
in the Categories pane and then "SN: BURxxxxxxxxx" in the Hardware Tool
pane (the x's are the unique ID number found on the back of your PICkit 3).
Then click Apply and then OK.

<li>Build the project by clicking the Debug Project in the toolbar area (to 
the right of the blue circular arrow).  You can also click Debug &rarr; 
Debug Project (inLab02).  This process may take 2-3 minutes.  During this time, 
you should see the project build in the Output &rarr; inLab02 (Build)
window and then some activity in the Output &rarr; PICkit3 window.  

<li>When
your program is running, you will notice a green progress square moving 
in the lower right corner of the MPLab X window and an orange "Pause 
(Ctrl+Alt+Pause)" button in the simulator control area of the toolbar. 
Go ahead and press the orange pause button. Your program should be paused 
on line 61.

<!--
<li>Now press F8 or the "Step Over" button in the simulator controls area 
of the toolbar.   Every time that you perform a Step Over function the
the PIC executes the highlighted line of code (stepping over any subroutine
calls).   Continue pressing F8 until your program enters the loop on line
61.
-->

<li>BUTTON_PIN is a reference to the value of the TOP button on the 
development board.  Note, that your development board is upright when 
Blaster is in his correct orientation.  Now press and hold down the 
TOP button the development board (changing the value of 
BUTTON_PIN to 0) while pressing
the F8 key several times.  You should notice that the program has stepped
to the "while (BUTTON_PIN == 0);" line of code and is holding there because
the TOP button is sending a logic 0 to the PIC.

<li>Now release the TOP button on the development board and press 
F8 several more times and iterate through the while loop on lines 65-68
several times and observe the LED toggling.

<li>Now press the "Step Into (F7)" in the 
simulator controls area of the toolbar (or just press F7).  You should
observe that you have stepped into the milliSecondDelay and then 
microSecondDelay functions.  The difference between step into and step 
over is that step into goes into subroutines while step over executes 
them in one simulation step. 

<li>Right mouse click on the line where the LED is toggled (line 66) and
select "Run to cursor".  You should see line 67 selected as the currently
running line of code.  Try pressing F8 several times while pressing and
releasing the TOP button on the development board.  Observe how the
button's state effects the flow of control in your code.

<li>Press the TOP button on the development board and F8, to get the
debugger into the loop that toggles LED_PIN.  Now click on the "Continue (F5)"
in the simulator controls area of the toolbar (or just press F5).  You 
will notice a green progress square moving in the lower right
corner of the MPLab X window and an orange "Pause (Ctrl+Alt+Pause)" button 
in the simulator control area of the toolbar.  These tell you that the 
debugger is running code on the PIC at full speed.  To stop execution, press
the pause button.  It's impossible to tell with certainty what line of
code was executing when you pressed the pause button, but most likely you
program will stop inside the microSecondDelay subroutine. 

<li>Running code using F5 allows you to conveniently execute large chunks of 
code quickly without having to single step through them, but the fact that
we did not know, for certain, where we would stop is a big drawback.  
Fortunately, breakpoints allow us to stop a running program anytime that
it attempts to execute a line of code that you have marked with a breakpoint.

<li>Set a breakpoint on the line where the LED is toggled (line 66).
Right mouse click on the "LED ^= 1;" in the editor pane. Select "Toggle 
Line Breakpoint".  Press the F5 key to run your program and note where 
execution stops.  Hold down the TOP button on the development board
and then press F5.  Now your program is outside the while loop that 
toggles the LED.  Press and release the TOP button on the development
board to re-enter the loop and stop at the breakpoint.

<li>Click on the Finish Debugger Session button in the toolbar when you
want to close-out your debugging session.

</ul>

<br><img src="./img/mplabWindow.jpg"><br><br>

<h3>Identify warnings errors</h3>
Let's intentionally create a couple of errors in our program  to see
how they are identified and resolved.   After introducing a change,
click on "Clean and Build Project" (hammer and brush icon) in the toolbar.
Note that "Clean and Build" is the same as compiling your project.
You will need to scroll through the console messages in the Build area at 
the bottom of the MPLAB X window to answer to find the warning/error
messages.

<ol start=9>
<li>Complete the following table by introducing each change one at a time.
After creating an error, fix it before moving to the next row of the table.
If a change creates both a warning and an error, note only the error.
If a change creates multiple errors, note only the first.
</ol>

<ul>
<li>In the "Warning or Error" column indicate if the change created a
warning, error or both a warning and error.  
<li>In the "Line number of Warning/Error" column indicate the line number
where the compiler thinks the problem(s) occurred.
<li>In the "Warning/Error message" column cut-and-paste the warning or error 
message(s) from the console window.  Typically these messages will be in blue 
font; a typical error message looks like:<br>
<font face="courier" color=blue>
inLab02.c:87: error: (195) expression syntax
</font><br>
This means that the compiler has found an "expression syntax" error on line 87.
Clicking on the blue message will take you to the line number where the
compiler has encountered the error.
</ul>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Change 	<td>Warning or Error <td>Line number of Warning/Error	<td>Warning/Error message
<tr><td>Remove the semicolon at the end of line 66.
	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>Remove one of the "=" in line 62 yielding "while(BUTTON_PIN = 0);"
	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>Add a call to a non-existent subroutine "pugs();" on line 60
	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp	<td>&nbsp
</table>


<h3>Running code on the development board</h3>
When debugging code on the development board, the PICkit 3 remains attached
to the development board so that it can halt the PIC 18F25K22 processor 
under your control (at a break-point or single stepping).  Running your
code means that the PIC 18F25K22 will no longer be under the control of
the PICkit 3.  For this reason, after you download your program to the
PIC 18F25K22 (on the development board), you will disconnect the SNAP from
the development board.  Since the PIC 18K25K22 is a flashed-based part, now
every time that the PIC is powered-up, it will run this program.


<ul>
<li>Connect the development board to a USB port on the PC.
<li>Connect the SNAP to a USB port on the PC.
<li>Connect the SNAP to the development board so that the black triangle
on the SNAP and the development board align. 
<li>In the toolbar click on the Clean and Build Project icon (hammer and
broom).
<li>In the toolbar click on the Run Project icons (green arrow pointing right).
<li>Check the "Do not show this message again" checkbox in the 
MPLab pop-up and then click OK.
<li>Three things will now happen that should alert you that the download
is in progress:
<ul>	<li>Text will scroll by in the SNAP tab of the console ending with
	<font face="courier">Programming/Verify complete</font>
	<li>The lower right corner of the MPLab X window you should see
	"inLab02 (Build, Load)" with a progress bar flashing
</ul>
<li>When programming is complete, press the TOP button and RB5 pin will
	quickly toggle its logic level.  
</ul>


<h3>Observe firmware behavior on oscilloscope</h3>
You will be using an oscilloscope to measure the period of RB5.  To do this
setup your oscilloscope as follows:
<br><br>


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>RB5
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Dev board ground loop
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>1ms
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>1V
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&uarr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.5V
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>
	[&uarr;Back]
	<li>Screen shot the screen on USB:<br>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Format</u> &rarr; 
	<u>24-bit Bit... (*.bmp)</u>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Press to Save</u>
</ul>
<br><br>

<ol start=10>
<li>Include the screen shot from the waveform save on your oscilloscope.
<li>Using the volts per division information on the oscilloscope screen and
the height of the waveform (described in divisions), show your calculation for 
the amplitude of the waveform on RB5.  For example, if your oscilloscope was
set to 1v/divisions and the waveform had an amplitude of 4.6 divisions, then
your answer would look like:
<pre>
Oscilloscope set to 1v/division
The amplitude of the RB5 waveform is 4.6 divisions

	  1v        
	-------- *  4.6 divisions = 4.6v
	division 
</pre>

<li>Using the time per division information on the oscilloscope screen and
the duration the waveform (described in divisions), show your calculation for 
the period of the waveform on RB5 using the same approach as the previous
problem.
</ol>


<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
As given the inLab02.c program does not generate a 500Hz waveform.
In this section you are going to determine the exact number of NOP statements
needed in the microSecondDelay subroutine function in order to create a 
precise 1 microsecond delay.  To do this you will run the program three times;
each time will have a different number of NOP statements in the 
microSecondDelay function and you are to record the delay created.  You will 
then interpolate this data to determine the exact number of NOPs needed to 
produce a 1 microsecond delay.
<br><br>

To do this, you will need to create an excel spreadsheet as follows.
<ul>	<li>Enter "#nop" in cell E3.  This column will be the number of NOP
	statements in the microSecondDelay function.
	<li>Enter "ns" in cell F3.  This column will be the delay measured
	using the simulator stopwatch.
	<li>Edit the microSecondDelay subroutine so that it has either
	4, 10, or 20 NOPs.  Run the program and observe the waveform
	on pin RB5 using an oscilloscope.  Measure the time high (or low)
	of the waveform (in microseconds) and record that value in cells 
	F4 (for 4 NOPs), F5 (for 10 NOPs), or F6 (for 20 NOPs).
	For more accurate and easier measurements on the oscilloscope do 
	the following
	<ul>
	<li>Press measure (Hard Button)
	<li>Press Add Measurement (Soft Button)
	<li>Scroll Down in the Menu on the screen
	<li>Under the Time header select +Width
	<li>You should now see two dashed vertical orange lines 
	surrounding the peak of your waveform. On the right-hand 
	side of the screen you should be able to see the time width 
	between these two lines in milliseconds
	</ul>


	<li>Select cells E3 through F6 by clicking on E3 and dragging to
	cell F6.
	<li>Insert &rarr; Insert Scatter (X,Y) or Bubble Chart &rarr; 
	Scatter with Straight Lines and Markers
	<li>Change the title to "ns delay vs. #NOPs"
	<li>Add a vertical axis label by first making sure that the 
	graph is selected.  Then select: Chart Tools &rarr; Design 
	&rarr; Add Chart Element &rarr; Axis Title &rarr; Primary 
	Vertical.  Change the label to "Delay(ns)"
	<li>Add a horizontal axis label by first making sure that the 
	graph is selected.  Then select: Chart Tools &rarr; Design 
	&rarr; Add Chart Element &rarr; Axis Title &rarr; Primary 
	Horizontal. Change the label to "number of NOPs"
	<li>Looking at the scatter chart you should be able to get 
	good idea of the number of NOPs needed to get a 1us = 1000ns delay
	by tracing along the horizontal grid at 1000ns to the data
	line and then following the intercept down to the number of
	NOPs.  However, I want you to determine this value quantitatively
	using the following steps.
	<li>Enter "m" in cell E8.  Enter the equation for the slope of
	the line in your chart in cell F8.  To do this select the cell
	F8 and enter "=(F6-F4)/(E6-E4)" in the formula bar at the top
	of the window.  Notice how the references are highlighted in
	spreadsheet.
	<li>Enter "b" in cell E9.
	Use some basic algebra along with the equation of a line
	to determine the equation for the y-intercept for the line 
	in terms of the y-value in cell F6, the x value in cell E6,
	and the slope in cell F8.  Enter this equation in cell F9.
	<li>Enter "y" in cell E11.  Enter the value "1000" in cell
	F11.  This is the delay in microseconds that we want. 
	<li>Enter "x" in cell E12.
	Use some basic algebra along with the equation of a line
	to determine the equation for the x-value of a straight line
	in terms of the y value entered in cell F11, the y-intercept
	in cell F9, and the slope in cell F8.
	<li>You should round a fractional value for the number of 
	NOPs to the closest whole number (because we cannot have a 
	fractional number of NOP statements).  Do this by entering
	"=round(F12,0)" in cell F13.
</ul>

When complete your spreadsheet should look something like this:
<br><img src="./img/excel.jpg"><br><br>

<ol start=13>
<li>Include the graph "ns delay vs. # NOPs"
<li>What is the equation you entered in cell F12 and how many NOPs
are required to generate a 1000 ns delay?
</ol>
