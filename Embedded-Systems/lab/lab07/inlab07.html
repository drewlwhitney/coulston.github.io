Lab 7 - In-lab activities</center>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions. Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to develop an understanding of how to
transmit IR bits from our development board.

<h2>Note</h2>
The gesture recognition hardware present in some cell-phones will
emit bursts of IR radiation, appearing as spurious IR data packets in
our environment. This can be very frustrating to achieving the objectives
of your and your neighbors lab. So please take a moment to put you cell
phone in an enclosed space like a backpack or pocket during the duration
of the lab.

<h2>External Hardware</h2>

<h3>IR LED</h3>
During last weeks lab you learned that bits sent from a handheld remote
control consists of two "half" bits. The voltage level of the half bits
is determined by the activity state of the transmitting IR LED. If the
IR LED is emitting light at 940nm and being turned on and off at 38kHz
then our IR receiver outputs a logic 0. Any other condition causes the
IR receiver to output a logic 1.


<h3>BJT basics</h3>
A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a three terminal electrical component
that has the ability to amplify signals. By amplify, I mean you can
input a small electrical signal and get a large electrical signal out.
For example a speaker which has a headphone input and plays loud music
has one or more amplifiers inside it.
<br><Br>

The image below at left shows the three terminals are named the collector,
base and emitter. Each of these three terminals will have a voltage
denoted V<sub>C</sub>, V<sub>B</sub>, V<sub>E</sub> respectively. The
difference between two of these voltages is denoted with two subscripts.
For example, V<sub>B</sub> - V<sub>E</sub> = V<sub>BE</sub>.
<br><br>

A BJT operates in one of four modes shown in the image below at right and
is determined by the voltage difference V<sub>BE</sub> and V<sub>BC</sub>.

<br><img src="./img/bjtModes.bmp"><br><Br>

<dl>
<dt>Saturation</dt>
<dd>In this mode, the connection between the collector and emitter
through the BJT acts as (almost) a short circuit. If you want to drive
a device with a maximum amount of current (like to illuminate an IR LED
really bright), this is the mode you want to be in.
</dd>
<dt>Cut-off</dt>
<dd>In this mode, the connection between the collector and emitter
through the BJT acts as (almost) an open circuit. If you want to turn-off
a device connected to the BJT (like an IR LED) then this is the mode you
want to be in.
<dt>Forward-active</dt>
<dd>In this mode, the current between the collector and emitter is
proportional to the current from the base to the emitter. If you wanted
to amplify an audio signal, then this is the mode you would want to be in.
<dt>Reverse-active</dt>
<dd>We will take a pass on this mode and move on.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>IR TX circuit</h3>
The schematic for the circuit used to illuminate the IR LED is shown
in the image below at left. I designed this circuit
to operate in either the saturation or cut-off modes.
We will explore the theory of this circuit and then take measurements
to understand where theory and reality agree and disagree. In order
to take measurements, you will be probing your development board
at the collector, base and emitter. The relationship between the
schematic and the layout is illustrated in the image below.
Take a moment to look at the layout of the IR TX circuit and your
development board so that you can locate the collector, base and emitter
of the BJT (in the upper corner of your development board).

<br><img src="./img/txCircuit.bmp"><br><br>

The questions below will require you to look up component parameters
from the component's technical datasheet. Searching Digikey for the
part numbers listed in the table below will produce a page containing
links to the PDF datasheets.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Part</td>      <td>Digikey Part Number</td>
<tr><td>Red LED		<td>160-1167-1-ND
<tr><td>IR LED		<td>475-3047-1-ND
<tr><td>NPN Transistor	<td>1727-4043-1-ND
</table>


<h3>IR LED Operation</h3>

The IR LED operates somewhere between the saturation and Forward-active
region. The following questions will guide you towards understanding
the theory of how the PIC interfaces to the IR TX circuit to produce
strong transmission pulses.

<h3>Saturation region</h3>
To turn-on the IR LED, RC1 is set to logic 1, 3.3V. Let's analyze the
IR TX circuit to understand how it operates in this mode, the
saturation region. The questions in this section, concern the same
scenario, a BJT in saturation. The answers to the questions in this
section may depend on other values that you will derive in this section.


<ol>	<li>If pin RC1 is at logic 1 (3.3V) and the base of the BJT is
	1.6V, how much current is flowing through the 300&ohm;
	resistor? Express your answer in milliamps.
	<li>Go to the graphs on page 6 of the technical document for
	the RED LED. How much current flows through the red LED at 1.6V?
	Given this value, how much current is flowing into the base of
	the BJT (subtract LED current from 300&ohm; current)?  Express
	your answers in milliamps.
	<li>Assume that the voltage drop from the base to the emitter
	of the BJT is 0.8V. What is V<sub>E</sub>?  You should assume
	the V<sub>B</sub> value from a the previous question.
	<li>Use Ohm's law to determine the current through the
	2.2&ohm; resistor connected to the emitter of the BJT. Express
	your answer in milliamps.
	<li> How much current is flowing through the IR LED (this is the
	same as I<sub>C</sub>) when RC1 is at logic 1? Use KCL and treat
	the BJT as a node.
	<li>At this I<sub>C</sub>, what is the voltage across the
	IR LED?  You will need to consult the Forward Current graph
	in the IR LED technical documents. From this voltage determine
	the value of V<sub>C</sub>. Hint, the value you read from the
	graph is NOT Vc. This value is the voltage drop across the IR LED.
	<li>What is the current gain h<sub>FE</sub>of the BJT?  The current
	gain is the ratio of the collector current over the base current.

<li>Use the information gathered from the previous questions to
complete the "Theory" column in the following table. You will
complete the Actual column in a later question (you will need to
probe the amplfier circuit with the oscilloscope probe).

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Value</td>	<td>Theory</td>        <td>Actual</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>B</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>E</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>C</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>BE</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>BC</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
</table>

</li>


<h3>Cut-off region</h3>

To turn-off the IR LED, RC1 is set to logic 0, 0V. Let's analyze the
IR TX circuit to understand how it operates in this mode, the cut-off
region.

<li>If pin RC1 is at logic 0 (0.0V) and no current flows
into the base from the collector, what is V<sub>B</sub>?
	<li>Look up the technical documents for the BJT and find the
	maximum collector cut-off current at room temperature?
	<li>Assuming the cut-off current flows through the 2.2&ohm;
	resistor, what is V<sub>E</sub>?
	<li>Assuming the cut-off current flows through the IR LED,
	what is V<sub>C</sub>?  Hint: Look back at the Forward Current
	graph for the IR LED. You may need to extrapolate a little
	based on the graph and your answer to a previous question.

<li>Use the information gathered from the previous questions to
complete the "Theory" column in the following table. You will
complete the Actual column in a later question.
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Value</td>	<td>Theory</td>        <td>Actual</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>B</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>E</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>C</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>BE</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td>V<sub>BC</sub>	<td>&nbsp;</td>		<td>&nbsp;</td>

<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
This week's lab will require you to use the PWM and timer subsystem
to generate a 38kHz pulse train with a 10% duty cycle for specific
durations.  The PWM period is given by the following equation
where T<sub>OSC</sub> is the period of the main oscillator and
TMR2 prescaler Value is 4 because we set the prescaler to 1:4

<pre>
PWM Period = (PR2 + 1) * 4 * T<sub>OSC</sub> * (TMR2 Prescale Value)
</pre>


<ol start=14>
<li>What is the value of PR2 used to generate a 38kHz waveform?  Hint,
you can check your answer using the register tab of the TMR2 window in
the MCC after you complete the configuration below.

<li>To the nearest integer, how much is a 1&micro;s change in period
in terms of PR2 counts.
</ol>

</ul>

Before running our code, let's take a look through the program
to understand what is going on.
<ol start=16>
<li>How much is the magnitude of PR2 being changed by the 'p' and 'P'
commands?  How much will this effect the period by?

<li>Look through the code for the TMR1 ISR to complete the state
diagram below. Label the arrows between states with the conditions
that cause the transition to take place. If there is no condition
(the transition is always taken) leave the arrow unlabeled. Inside
each state, list all the actions that take place when the ISR is in
that state in a C-code format. If an action is dependent on which
state the ISR goes to next (typically inside an if/then), then place
that action on an arc (on the oppsite side of the arc from the
condition which caueses that arc to be taken).

<br><img src="./img/fsmISR.bmp"><br><br>

</ol>

The following instructions will help you dial-in the oscilloscope settings
to view the waveform as shown in the figure below.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>IR_TX jumper
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Ground loop
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>1 ms
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>2 V
<tr><td>Ch2 probe		<td>RC0
<tr><td>Ch2 (scale) 		<td>2 V
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&uarr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.6V
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the second lowest reticule on the lower half of
	the oscilloscope screen,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
	<li>Align Ch 2 on the second lowest reticule on the upper half of
	the oscilloscope screen,
</ul>

When you get the oscilloscope configured correctly and inlab07 downloaded,
you should see the following on the oscilloscope when you type 'S'. Note,
there is going to be a lot of IR traffic floating around in the lab today.
Someone else may have their IR LED broadcasting at the exact same moment
that you are trying to read your IR receiver.  It is helpful to run the
scope in single mode to capture an individual waveform. Please note
depenging on which character you send, your waveform will be different
from the one shown. If your signal is extremely noisy connect both
ground leads on the probes to the ground loop on the development board.
If you get weird results on
your IR receiver, try reacquiring IR data or put the oscilloscope into
STOP mode by pressing the stop button on the upper right of the
oscilloscope face.

<br><img src="./img/scopeNominal.bmp"><br><br>

<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>

Note, that the IR radiation from your IR LED is bouncing around the room,
back into the IR receiver. This happens because the IR LED is very bright
and the IR receiver is very sensitive. While the IR receiver is very
sensitive, it has strict bounds on what it will interpret as a valid
signal. In the following experiments, you will investigate where these
bounds.

<ol start=18>
<li>Using the 'S' menu option for this question. How many PWM pulses must
be sent by the IR LED before the IR receiver transitions from logic 1 to
logic 0?  You will need to change the horizontal scale on your oscilloscope
to measure this value. Adjust your horizontal scale until you see something
like the following.
</ol>

<br><img src="./img/irWave.bmp"><br><br>

This question seeks to determine what range of PWM frequencies are
interpreted correctly by the IR remote control decoder chip.
To do this, set up your oscilloscope according to the setup instructions
above. Add a frequency and period measurement on channel 1 on the
oscilloscope.<br><br>

The 'P' function increases the period of the PWM waveform, decrease the
PWM frequency. Increase the PWM period until the IR packet just starts
being interpreted is still incorrectly.
Use the oscilloscope's measurement
function to determine the frequency of the PWM waveform just when this
starts to happen.
<br><br>

Use the 'p' function to decrease the period of the PWM waveform, increasing
the frequency of the PWM waveform. Decrease the PWM period until the IR
packet just starts being interpreted incorrectly. Use the oscilloscope's
measurement function to determine the frequency of the PWM waveform just
when this starts to happen.


<ol start=19>
<li>What range of frequencies is interpreted correctly?
</ol>


<h3>Measuring actual BJT voltages</h3>
We will now collect the missing values in the "Actual" columns
for problems 8 and 13. To do this you should consult the
Schematic and Layout images in the "IR TX circuit" section of this
inlab. Do this using your oscilloscope and the "S" function of
the inLab code to get the voltage around the BJT.
Removing the tip of the oscilloscope (as shown in the
image below) makes probing the BJT terminals easier. In the image below,
the student is probing the collector of the BJT and the oscilloscope
is showing the collector dropping from the cut-off region (IR LED
off) to the saturation region (IR LED on) when the "S" key was pressed.
You should use the values on the oscilloscope to fill in the "Actual"
column in the tables for question 8 and question 13.
Note the ground clips of both oscilloscope probes are electrically
connected, so connecting one ground clip, makes both probes measure
voltages relative to that ground reference.
