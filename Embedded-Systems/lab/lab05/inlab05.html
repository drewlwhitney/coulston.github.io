<h2>Requirements</h2>
Working in teams of two, read through the following lab activity and perform all the actions prescribed. You do not need to document bullet items. Make a record of your response to numbered items and turn them in a single copy as your teams solution on Canvas using the instructions posted there.

Include the names of both team members at the top of your solutions. Use complete English sentences when answering questions. If the answer to a question is a table or other piece of art (like an oscilloscope trace or a figure), then include a sentence explaining the piece of art. Only include your answers, do not include the question-text unless it is absolutely needed.



<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to teach you how to create a terminal
interface to your microcontroller.

<h2>External Hardware</h2>
The firmware that you will be working today will allow you to manipulate
the state of the LED using a terminal application running on a PC. We
will focus here on the newest piece of hardware, the FT230 chip.
<br><br>


<h3>FT230</h3>
The FT230 chip acts as a USB to serial bridge. This chips allows
a microcontroller to use the RS232 communication protocol to a serial
terminal application on a PC  using a USB cable. This little piece of
magic is accomplished using the FT230 chip and software residing on
the PC as illustrate in the following figure.

<br><img src="./img/vcom.bmp"><br><br>

Any character sent from the PIC on pin RC6, as a series of bits, is
transformed into a USB signal by the FT230 chip, and decoded by a
software driver residing on the PC into a series of bit sent over a
COM port. You can configure a terminal application like PuTTY to
decode the bits from a COM port into character printed in the terminal
window on your PC. Similarly, character typed into the terminal (using
your PC's keyboard) are sent to pin RC7 of the PIC. <br><Br>

When you plug your development board into a PC you may have noticed that your
PC makes chime sound. This tells you that the PC has recognized the
FT230 chip and assigned it a COM port. A PC may have any number of COM
ports, so each is given a unique numerical value. There are a variety
of different ways to determine the COM port assigned to your FT230 chip,
but I find the easiest to run
<a href="../../COMSniffer.exe">Brandon's COM port finder</a>. There is
also a link to this application on the class main page. Plug your development
board into your PC and run this application. You should see something
similar to the following; in this case my FT230 chip has been assigned COM3.
Note that more than likely your PC will assign your FT230 a different
port number. You will need the port number anytime you need to connect
your PIC to a a terminal application like PuTTY.

<br><img src="./img/COMSniffer.bmp"><br><br>

Now that we know the identity of the COM port created to our PIC,
let's start by looking at how ASCII character are represented as a series
of bits using an oscilloscope. Start by launching
PuTTY. Select Connection type = Serial in the initial pop-up
screen - use COMx where "x" is the COM port number assigned to your FT230
chip. Adjust the default speed (adjusted through Category ->
Connection -> Serial) 9600 baud (bits per second) - this step is not usually
needed, but included just in case it is.
<br><Br>

You do not need to program your PIC in order to perform the following
experiment, just leave your lab 4 music player programmed on your board.
Now setup the oscilloscope to view the bit stream coming from PuTTY into
the PIC using the following setup:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Ch1 probe		<td>RC7
<tr><td>Ch1 ground clip		<td>Development board ground loop
<tr><td>Horizontal (scale) 	<td>200 us
<tr><td>Ch1 (scale) 		<td>1V
<tr><td>Trigger mode		<td>Auto
<tr><td>Trigger source		<td>1
<tr><td>Trigger slope		<td>&darr;
<tr><td>Trigger level		<td>1.5V
</table>

Make sure to:
<ul>	<li>Align Ch 1 on the <u>third</u> lowest reticule so as to
	leave room for the decoded serial character,
	<li>Align the horizontal position at the second left-most reticule,
</ul>

<li>Type a "5" in PuTTY - the "5" will NOT appear in the PuTTY window.
You should see the flicker of bits being sent and
then a short time later they will go away. In order to get the bits to
stay on the screen you need to switch the oscilloscope triggering from auto
to normal mode. [Mode/Coupling] &rarr; <u>Mode</u> &rarr; <u>Normal</u>
<br><br>

Again, type "5" in PuTTY and the bit stream of ASCII '5' sent from the PC
to the PIC will stay on the oscilloscope. Note that
the data bits are 0b00110101 when arranged from MSB (left-most bit) to LSB
(right-most bit). This converts to 0x35 which is the ASCII code for the
number 5. Note: The image below has CH1 aligned to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
lowest reticule, it should be aligned to the 3<sup>rd</sup>
lowest reticule.
<br><img src="./img/scope_0.bmp"><br><br>

Finally, let's get the oscilloscope to convert this stream of bits
into an ASCII character using the following oscilloscope setup.

<ul>	<li>Convert serial stream<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Mode</u> &rarr; UART/RS232<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Serial</u> &rarr; Serial 1: UART/RS232 &check;<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Signals</u> &rarr; Rx &rarr; 1<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Signals</u> &rarr; <u>Threshold</u> &rarr; (Trigger Level) &rarr; 1.65V<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Bus Config</u> &rarr; <u>#Bits</u> &rarr; 8<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Bus Config</u> &rarr; <u>Parity</u>  &rarr; None<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Bus Config</u> &rarr; <u>Baud Rate</u> &rarr; <u>Baud</u> &rarr; 9600 b/s<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Bus Config</u> &rarr; <u>Polarity</u> &rarr; Idle high<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>Bus Config</u> &rarr; <u>Bit Order</u> &rarr; LSB<br>
	[Serial] &rarr; <u>settings</u> &rarr; <u>Base</u> &rarr; ASCII<br>

	<li>Clear all menus off the bottom of the screen<br>
	[&uarr;Back]
	<li>Screen shot the screen on USB:<br>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Format</u> &rarr;
	<u>24-bit Bit... (*.bmp)</u>
	[Save] &rarr; <u>Save</u> &rarr; <u>Press to Save</u>
</ul>
<br><br>
Try pressing different keys in PuTTY and observe the decoded stream on
the oscilloscope. Try the arrow keys (you will need to change the
time base to 1ms/division), delete, backspace. Some of characters
are escaped so the terminal interprets them not as character to print,
but rather as terminal control commands.

<ol start=1>
<li>Screen capture the '5' character on your oscilloscope and include it
in your report. Make sure to show the serial decoding at
the bottom of the screen.
</li>

<li>
Complete the following table for the character listed in the left most
column. Remember that every transmitted character has a start and
stop bit (do not include) and is transmitted LSB first.
<ul>
<li>Fill in the "Bit period" column with the shortest bit period (in
microseconds) duration for that character. To determine the bit period,
find, and measure, the shortest logic "1" or logic "0" pulse. You can
measure the duration of the pulse using the horizontal scale or by using
the Cursor function activated by pressing the cursor button.
<li>Fill in the "Bit frequency" column with the reciprocal of the Bit period.
Use units of bps (bits per seconds) instead of Hertz (cycles per second).
<li>Extract the 8-bit binary code from the data sent, making sure to
ignore start and stop bits and ordering them from MSB (left) to LSB (right)
and put it into the "Binary code for data" column,
<li>Convert the 8-bit binary code data into 2 hex characters and put
the value in the "Hex code for data" column,
<li>Use an external resource to look-up the ASCII character for each of
the Hex codes and put it into the "ASCII char for data" column.
</ul>


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Character sent<td>Bit period (us) <td>Bit frequency (bps)
<td>Binary code for data<td>Hex code for data<td>ASCII char for data bits
<tr><td>'a' <td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>'A' <td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>&lt;Enter&gt;<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp
<tr><td>&lt;Backspace&gt;<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp<td>&nbsp
</table>
</ol>
<!--
'a' = 0110 0001 = 0x61 = ascii 'a'
'A' = 0100 0001 = 0x41 = ascii 'A'
<Enter> = 0000 1101 = 0x0D = ascii CR - carriage return
--->

Note that certain keys will produce multiple bytes sent. For example
the left arrow key will send 0x1B, 0x5B, 0x44 corresponding to escape,
[, D. These sequence are called escape sequence and are used by
terminals to send special characters that do not exist in ASCII.
Experiment with &lt;Del&gt;, number pad keys, and the arrow keys to
see some examples of escape codes. You can get more information
<a href="http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences.php">here</a>.
Note, that goofing around with the function keys will most likely hang
your development board. Try using the reset "button" near the USB port
to reset your board if it hangs.


<h2>Internal Subsystem</h2>
The Enhanced Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
(EUSART) subsystem of the PIC can be configured to send and receive
ASCII characters to a terminal application on a PC. The configuration
of the EUSART subsystem is described in the PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet.
The PIC has two EUSARTs denoted EUSART1 and EUSART2. When you encounter
register and field name references in the Data Sheet that contain a
lower-case "x", like TXREGx, you should substitute "1" or "2" for the "x"
depending on which EUSART you are working with. On our development board, I
have connected EUSART1 to the FT230 chip, so we will always substitute
"1" for "x". Remember that a field is a named collection of bits within
a register.

<ol start=3>
<li>Using Table 2 on page 6 of the Data Sheet (for the 28-pin SSOP package),
what I/O pins are associated with the EUSART1?  Note, we are not
using the EUSART2 subsystem nor its associated pins.

<li>The baud rate generator inside the PIC slows down the main oscillator
by dividing it by the value stored in the baud rate generator register
pair SPBRGH1:SPBRG1 to make the 9600 baud rate clock used to produce bits.
Note the ":" symbol separating the two register names means that we are
building a 16-bit value with SPBRGH1 as the upper 8-bits and SPBRG1 as
the lower bits.
The relationship between the main oscillator frequency (Fosc) and the
baud rate is given in Baud Rate Formula column of Table 16-3 in the
Microchips PIC18(L)F2X/4XK22 Data Sheet. The value n in the equation
(per the legend) is the SPBRGH1:SPBRG1 register pair and the answer to
this question.
<br>
The bit sequence observed in the previous section was
asynchronous (SYNC = 0) because it was not accompanied by a clock.
We will be using the high speed 16-bit baud rate generator (BRG16 = 1 and
BRGH=1).
<br>
Determine the value for the 16-bit baud rate generator SPBRGH1:SPBRG1 to
generate a 9600 baud rate assuming that the PIC is running at 64MHz.
Show your work and state your 16-bit answer in hexadecimal.

<li>Look at the Figures 16-1 and 16-2, what register would you write to in
order to transmit (TX) a data byte out of the PIC?  What register would you
read in order to receive (RX) a data byte sent into the PIC?  Note that
these registers need to be connected to the data bus.

<li>Look at the Figures 16-1 and 16-2, what flag indicates when a
data byte can be transmitted out of the PIC?  What flag indicates
that a data byte has been received by the PIC? Note that these flags
are connected to the TX and RX register.

<li>Read about the TX1IF and RC1IF flag in the PIR1 register defined on
page 112. How are each of these flags cleared?
</ol>

</ul>
In a future question you will need the information listed in the
PWM parameters. Save yourself a little time and write down the values
for PWM period, PWM Resolution, and PWM Frequency. Note that while the PWM
resolution only requires 8-bits, you must use a 16-bit integer to hold the
value because there are options which allow the PWM resolution to be
greater than 8-bits.


<li>File &rarr; Save All&hellip;
<li>Click on the "Generate" button in the Project Resources section of the
Resource Management tab. You should note activity in the Output area of the
console showing that the code configurator is creating files associated
with your project. Anytime that you make a change to the configuration
you must re-generate the supporting files by clicking on the generate
button,
<li>Double click the file main.c to open it in the editor window.
<li>Replace the contents of main.c with
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="./code/inlab05Classic.c">inlab05Classic.c</a></li>
	<li> <a href="./code/inlab05Melody.c">inlab05Melody.c</a></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<li>Compile and download the code to the PIC,
<li>Launch PuTTY and connect to the serial port associated with the
FT230 chip,
<li>Type "?" in the terminal. You should see,
<pre>
------------------------------
?: Help menu
o: k
Z: Reset processor
z: Clear the terminal
t: Display current TMR2
T: Display current TMR0
p/P: decrease/increase duty cycle
------------------------------
</pre>
<li>Connect a jumper wire between RC2 and an LED and experiment
with the duty cycle,
<li>Experiment with the commands - see discussion below.
</ul>

<b>?</b><br>
Every terminal program that you write this term needs to have a help
menu which tells the operator what commands they can issue and a
brief description of what the commands can do. In some labs you will
include some basic status information at the top of the help menu.
<br><br>

<b>Z</b><br>
While developing an embedded systems application it is useful to perform
a software reset of the PIC. This reset will reveal the "splash screen",
a welcome screen displayed at system start-up. I put some basic information
on the splash screen including the wiring information. After downloading your
program you will not see
the splash-screen because your program has already started running and is
waiting for terminal input. I would encourage you to include some ASCII
art in your splash screen to customize your system - search "ASCII art
generator".
<br><Br>

<b>z</b><br>
Sometimes you just want all the garbage on the terminal screen to go away.
<br><br>

<b>t/T</b><br>
The value may appear random  because the timer is counting up and
rolling over so quickly.
<br><br>

<b>p/P</b><br>
I often use a upper and lower case letter for
commands that decrease (lower case) or increase (upper case) some
system value. In order to see the LED light-up make sure that you
have a jumper wire connected between RC2 and an LED.  Adjust the
duty cycle to turn the LED off remembering that the RGB LED is
active low.
<br><br>

Before moving on, let's examine some of the helper functions generated
by MCC that you will need to use in your lab this week. In the project
manager window expand Header Files &rarr; MCC Generated Files. Double click
and open all the ".h" files in the subfolders of this folder that do not end in
"_deprecated.h". Use the contents of the files to answer the following questions.

<ol start=8>
<li>Each function prototype has a comprehensive block of comments that
precede each function prototype. Look through the "@brief" comments
and identify the function that "Loads the 16-bit duty cycle value."  List
the associated function prototype.

<li>What register and field are used for the EUSART1_IsRxReady function?
Note, this is in eusart1.c. You can open this quickly by holding CTRL and
clicking on "EUSART1_IsRxReady" while inside eusart1.h.

<li>When writing a value to TMR0 using the TMR0_CounterSet function, what
data-type should the input argument be?

<li>Look in tmr0.h. If you wanted to clear the TMR0 interrupt flag, which
function would you use? Inside this function, how is the TMR0 interrupt
flag cleared? Note, you can use the same CTRL+click trick from earlier.

</ol>

In the project manager window expand Source Files &rarr; MCC Generated
Files. Double click and open all the ".c" files in the subfolders of this folder
that do not end in "_deprecated.h". Use the contents of the files to answer
the following questions.
<ol start=12>
<li>In the EUSART1_Initialize function (found in MCC Generated Files
&rarr; uart &rarr; src &rarr; eusart1.c), what 16-bit value (in hex) is written
to the baud rate generator registers SPBRGH1:SPBRG1?  Compare this value to an
earlier answer.

<li>What PIC data registers does the EUSART1_Read function get the incoming
character from?  Hint, it is the returned value.
What PIC data registers does the EUSART1_Write function put
the outgoing character to?

<li>What flag does EUSART1 check to see if Rx (recieve) is ready?

<li>What flags does EUSART1 check to see if Tx (transmit) is ready?
</ol>

In the project manager window double click and open main.c. Use the contents
of main.c to answer the following questions.
<ol start=16>
<li>List the invocation(s) of #defines contained in the MCC Generated
Header Files that are present in the main.c file. Hint, these should be
light blue.

<li>List all calls to functions contained in the MCC Generated Source
Files that are present in the main.c file. Hint, these are usually functions
that are black and not defined within the main.c file.
</ol>

Open up the Microchips XC8 Compiler User's Guide posted on the class web
page and goto the PRINTF function on page 392-393.
<ol start=18>
<li>Is there a format character to print a value in binary?  If so what is it?
Is there a format character to print a value in octal?  If so what is it?
Is there a format character to print a value in hexadecimal?  If so what is it?
What is the difference between using an upper or lower case "x" when printing
values?

<li>For the RESET function on page 400,
what library do you need to include in order to access this function?
What MCC Generate header files (there are more than one), found in
your project, contains the #include to this library?
</ol>


<h2>Firmware Experiments</h2>
To answer the following question, add a bunch of printf statements
to your program under the "f: print using several format specifiers."
menu option. For each (format, value) pair in the following table,
determine the output produced by printf on the terminal. For example to
determine the output produced by the %u format with the value of
0xABCD you would put the following code in your program:
<font face="courier">printf("%u\r\n",0xABCD);</font>.
If the result is a non-printable character, put "non-character" in the
corresponding space.
In the row labeled "decimal" determine the unsigned decimal equivalent
of each value, computed by you using the windows calculator program.

<ol start=20>

<li>Complete the table using the output shown in the terminal.
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>format	<td>'0'	<td>0x30  <td>0xAB  <td>0xABCD	<td>0xABCD0123
<tr><td>%c	<td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>unprintable <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>%u	<td>&nbsp; <td>48     <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>%d	<td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>291
<tr><td>%x	<td>30     <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>%04x	<td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>abcd   <td>&nbsp;
<tr><td>decimal	<td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp; <td>171   <td>&nbsp; <td>&nbsp;
</table>
</li>

<li>As you discovered in the previous problem, printing out 32-bit values
is problematic. Problematic in the sense that it cannot be done. If you
need to print a 32-bit value you must print it as a pair of 16-bit values,
the upper 16-bits and then the lower 16-bits. To do this you will need to
use a shift operation to move the upper 16-bits (of the 32-bit variable)
into the lower 16-bits. Then you will need to mask off the lower 16-bits
(of the 32-bit variable).
<pre>
	uint32_t var32 = 0xABCD0123;
	// print var32>>16 in a single printf statement
	// print var32&0xFFFF in a single printf statement
</pre>
Write a pair of printf statements that prints 8 hexadecimal characters
of a 32-bit variable with "0x" in front of the 8 hexadecimal characters.
You need to print leading zero's in each 4 hex character output
using the "04" format specifier. Obviously, it would be a good idea to
try out your idea in code.
<br><br>

<dir>
I have not been able to get the following to work on our compiler.
Having this capability would really simplify printing 32-bit
integers.
<i>
If you put <font face="courier">#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;</font>
at the top of your program (just below mcc_generated_file/mcc.h)
then you can use the following to print 32-bit variables.
</i>
<pre>
printf("0x%08" PRIx32 "\r\n",var32);
</pre>
</dir>

<li>Connect an oscilloscope to RC2 and determine the PWM resolution.
The PWM resolution is the time (in us) per duty cycle count.
To do this:
<ul>	<li>Measure the time high of the PWM waveform,
	<li>Note this initial duty cycle value,
	<li>Change the duty cycle value, noting the new value,
 	<li>Measure the time high of the PWM waveform,
	<li>Compute the difference of the times high,
	<li>Compute the difference between the duty cycle values,
	<li>Compute the ratio difference in times high over difference in
