<h2>Lab 5 assignment</h2>
Build firmware to smoothly and continuously change the colors on the LEDs
according to the 6-color tour shown below.

<br><img src="./img/sixColorCube.bmp"><br><br>

<h2>Software</h2>
Write an ISR to generate a color tour. A color tour is a
gradual change in color along the purple edges in the image above.
Each edge traverse should take about 0.25 seconds, meaning the entire
color tour should take about 1.5 seconds. Each point on the color
tour has a red, green and blue (RGB) component which, when mixed together,
determines the color of the LED. A particular combination of RGB
values is called a color coordinate. For example, the vertex labeled
"fuchsia" has color coordinate (0, 255, 0).
<br>

The transition from one vertex to another will consist of 256
distinct steps and take a total of 0.256 seconds. Each invocation
of the TMR ISR should move one step. Thus a total of 256 ISR invocations
are required to traverse an edge of the color tour. Each invocation of
the ISR should will make an incremental update to the color coordinate
displayed on the RGB LED.
<br><Br>

The color coordinates in the color tour represent the duty cycle of the
PWM channel controlling the color in the order (red, green, blue).
For example, at the vertex labeled "fuchsia (0,255,0)", the duty cycle
of the red, green, blue LEDs are 0, 255, 0.
Remember that the PWM duty cycles are 8-bit values (0 to 255) and that
our LEDs are active low so a duty cycle of 255 turns the LED off and
a duty cycle of 0 turns the LED on fully. So the fuchsia vertex has
maximal red and blue color and no green.
<br><Br>

If the color tour moved from the fuchsia vertex (with color coordinate
(0,255,0)) to the blue vertex with color coordinate (255, 255, 0). In
this case, each invocation of the ISR will subtract 1 from the duty
cycle of the red LED while leaving the duty cycle of the green and blue
LEDs alone.
<Br><Br>

In order to enjoy the full effect of your program, you should build some
sort of light diffuser so that you aren't blinded by the LED output.
Another eye saving technique is to turn-off all the LEDs at start-up.
<br><br>

At start-up your program should present a splash screen - this would
be a great place for some
<a href="http://www.glassgiant.com/ascii/">ASCII art</a>.  The splash
screen should also contain connection instruction for the development board
(where to install jumper wires). When you press "?" you should be
greeted with the following menu.

<pre>
------------------------------
    Red:   0x3f
    Green: 0x3f
    Blue:  0x3f
------------------------------
?: Help menu
Z: Reset processor
z: Clear the terminal
R/r: increase/decrease Red intensity
G/g: increase/decrease Green intensity
B/b: increase/decrease Blue intensity
C/c: start/stop color cycle
a: All LEDs off
+/-: increase/decrease the color tour speed.
------------------------------
</pre>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Status</b><br>
Display the current 8-bit duty cycle on the three channels. The register
CCPR1L contains the least significant 8-bits of the duty cycle and prints
out nicely. Print the values in hex with a leading "0x" added. On start-up
your program should turn off all the LEDs - this will save your eyes the
shock of bright LEDs.
<br><br>

<li><b>?</b><br>
Prints out the ever useful help menu.
<br><br>

<li><b>z</b><br>
Clear the terminal using a bunch of new lines.
<br><br>

<li><b>z</b><br>
Reset the processor so that we can see that splash screen.
<br><br>

<li><b>R/r</b><br>
Upper-case "R" should increase the duty cycle of the PWM channel associated
with the red LED. Remember that since we have active low LEDs, this will
actually make the LED appear dimmer. Lower-case "r" should decrease the
duty cycle of the PWM channel associate with the red LED. These changes
to the duty cycle value should saturate at 255 and 0. This means that
you should not allow the user to increase the duty cycle past 255 or
decrease the duty cycle below 0.

<li><b>G/g</b><br>
Same for the green PWM channel.
<br><br>

<li><b>B/b</b><br>
Same for the blue PWM channel.
<br><br>

<li><b>C</b><br>
Start a color tour. To do this, main should set a global variable
colorTour to true. The TMR ISR will then use this flag to step
through the color tour as follows.
<Br><br>

Store the duty cycles of the vertices of the tour in three arrays initRed,
initGreen, initBlue (see below). Store the changes in the duty cycles
at each ISR invocation in three arrays deltaRed, deltaGreen, deltaBlue
(see below). In the code given below, element 0 in the init
arrays represents the yellow vertex (0, 0, 255). Element 1 in the init
array represents the red vertex (0, 255, 255). In order to move from the
yellow vertex to the red vertex, each ISR invocation needs to increment the
green duty cycle by 1 and leave the red and blue duty cycles alone.
After 255 ISR invocations, the green duty cycle would change from 0 to 255
landing us at the red vertex. At this point you would be on the edge
from the red vertex to the fuchsia vertex. While moving down this edge
you will need to decrement the blue duty cycle during each ISR invocation.
This is why the delta[1] value is -1 (represented as 0xFFFF in hex).

<pre>
uint16_t deltaRed[NUM_COLOR] = {0x0000,  0x0000,   0x0001, &hellip;
uint16_t deltaGre[NUM_COLOR] = {0x0001,  0x0000,   0x0000, &hellip;
uint16_t deltaBlu[NUM_COLOR] = {0x0000,  0xFFFF,   0x0000, &hellip;

uint16_t initRed[NUM_COLOR] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, &hellip;
uint16_t initGre[NUM_COLOR] = {0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, &hellip;
uint16_t initBlu[NUM_COLOR] = {0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, &hellip;
</pre>

The ISR will need to maintain the values of the current edge of
the color tour, which step it is on along that edge, and the current
red, green, and blue PWM duty cycles in persistent local variables.
When the ISR gets to the end of a tour, it should start the tour
from the start.

<li><b>c</b><br> The lower-case c stops the color tour by
setting the colorTour global variable to false. You can leave the
colors as you found them or turn off all the PWM channels, your
choice.

<li><b>+/-</b><br> Allow the user, in main, to increase or decrease
the interrupt frequency of the ISR in 0.2 milliseconds intervals
using the plus or minus keys. Do not allow the user to decrease the
interrupt frequency lower than 0.2 millisecond. The program should
start-up with an interrupt frequency set so that each edge of the
color tour takes about 0.256 seconds.

<li><b>a</b><br>
Turn all the PWM channels off and save your eyes.

</ul>


<h3>Flowchart</h3>
One of the lab assistants has kindly offered to draw-up a flow chart
describing how main and the ISR interact to produce a color tour.
Check out the attached link and let me know what you think.
<a href="./Lab5FlowChart.pdf">Lab 5 flowchart</a>


<h3>5 point bonus</h3>
<table>
<tr>	<td><img src="./img/sixColorCube.bmp"></td>
	<td><img src="./img/threeColorCube.bmp"></td></tr>
<tr>	<td>Six color tour shown in purple.</td>
	<td>Three color tour shown in purple.</td></tr>
</table>
As a bonus add compiler directives that allow your code to be compiled
as either a 6-color tour or a 3-color tour by <u>switching a single
define value</u>, NUM_COLOR between 6 and 3. In other words if your
code is compiled with:
<pre>
	#define NUM_COLOR	6
</pre>
then the "c" command (see below) will generate a 6-color tour. On the other
hand, if your code is compiled with:
<pre>
	#define NUM_COLOR	3
</pre>
then the "c" command will generate a 3-color tour. To accomplish this
you will need to use the compiler directives #if, #elif, #end to switch
which  delta&lt;COLOR&gt;, init&lt;COLOR&gt; arrays is used
as the color tour. The #if and #elif directives should
use the value of NUM_COLOR in their conditionals. The
#if to #end statements should only include the array
declarations, there should be no code in this region. All the loops that
iterate through the colors in the tour should use NUM_COLOR instead of
constants values (like 3 or 6).
