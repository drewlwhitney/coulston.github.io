<h2>Lab 9 assignment</h2>
Create an embedded application that writes audio data to the SD Card
that, in the next lab, will be played back through the speaker.
The general architecture of the lab is shown below. You will use an
ISR to collect microphone samples and store them in one of two buffers,
the blue buffer in the figure below. While samples are being stored
in the blueBuffer, the redBuffer is being sent out to the SD Card
over the SPI but through the SDCARD_WriteBlock interface function
supplied in this inLab. Once blueBuffer is full and the redBuffer has
been sent, their roles are swapped. The blueBuffer is then sent to
the SD Card and, while this is being done,  new microphone samples are
sent to the redBuffer. This is called double buffering and an
important technique in signal processing.

<h2>Software</h2>
At start-up your program should present a splash screen - this would
be a great place for some ASCII art. The splash screen should also contain
connection instruction for the development board; for this assignment tell
the user there are no jumpers to install! When you press "?" at the
terminal you should be greeted with the following menu.

<pre>
-------------------------------------------------
?: help menu
o: k
Z: Reset processor
z: Clear the terminal
-------------------------------------------------
i: Initialize SD card
-------------------------------------------------
a/A decrease/increase read address
r: read a block of 512 bytes from SD card
1: write perfect 26 value sine wave to 128 blocks
-------------------------------------------------
+/-: Increase/Decrease the sample rate by 10 us
W: Write microphone => SD card at 1600 us
s: spool memory to a csv file
-------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<ul>
<li><b>?</b><br>
Prints out the ever useful help menu.
<br><br>

<li><b>Z</b><br>
Reset the processor so that we can see that splash screen.
<br><br>

<li><b>z</b><br>
Clear the terminal using a bunch of new lines.
<br><br>

<li><b>i</b><br>
Initialize the SD Card using the routines given in the inLab code.
<br><br>

<li><b>r</b><br>
This should read a block from the SD CArd and display it to the terminal
just as was done in the inLab code - just cut-and-paste.
<br><br>

<li><b>a/A</b><br>
decrement or increment the address used to read the memory. This is
also a cut-and-paste from the inlab code.
<br><br>


<li><b>1</b><br>
In order to test next weeks program, it will be very helpful to have
a known waveform stored in the SD Card. Let's do future you a favor
and take care of this now. Copy the following sine wave
over and over again in the SD Card. You need to copy the wave
"smoothly" across block boundaries. In other words, when your code runs
out of room in one block at sin[index], the first value stored in the
next block should be sin[index+1], NOT sin[0]. Continue storing sine
waves until the user presses any key. After a keypress, tell the user
how many blocks have been stored.

<pre>
const uint8_t   sin[SINE_WAVE_ARRAY_LENGTH] = {128,	159,	187,	213,	233,	248,	255,	255,	248,	233,	213,	187,	159,	128,	97,	69,	43,	23,	8,	1,	1,	8,	23,	43,	69,	97};
</pre>

To test this function, store at least 2 blocks worth of sine waves, then
use the 's' function
and spool out at least 2 blocks worth of data to verify that the sin
wave smoothly crosses the block boundry. In other words, the sine wave
should have no discontinuity when crossing the block boundry.
<br><br>


You need to insert a delay beteen consectutive block writes for the
"1" function. I did this by placing a TMR1 delay loop after the
each call to SDCARD_WriteBlock. I configured TMR1 to run with a 1:8
prescaler.

<pre>
for (blockCount = 0; blockCount &lt; MAX_NUM_BLOCKS; blockCount++) {

  // for loop to fill the redBuffer with 512 sin wave samples

  SDCARD_WriteBlock(loopSDcardAddress, redBuffer);
  while ((status = SDCARD_PollWriteComplete()) == WRITE_NOT_COMPLETE);

  // Slow down the write sequence to insure that blocks are written
  TMR1_CounterSet(0x0000);
  PIR1bits.TMR1IF = 0;
  while (PIR1bits.TMR1IF == 0);
} // end for blockCount
</pre>

Note, do NOT do this in the "W" function. The aquisition of the samples
takes 51.2 ms which is more than enough time between SDCARD_WriteBlock
calls.

<br><br>



<li><b>+/-</b><br>
Change SAMPLE_RATE from a #define to a global variable sampleRate.
Initialize the sampleRate to generate an interrupt every 100&micro;s.
Allow the '+' function the increase the sampleRate by 10&micro;s and
the '-' function the decrease the sampleRate by 10&micro;s. Do not
allow the sampleRate to go below 20&micro;s.

<br><br>
<li><b>W</b><br>
This will record the microphone values converted through the ADC into the
SD Card at the sampling rate (default to 100 us). When the user types
'W' in the terminal window, prompt with user with
<font face="courier">Press any key to start recording audio and
press  any key to stop recording.</font>.
This will allow the user to get all set-up without having to pay attention
to which key they press in order to start the audio recording.
<br><br>

Your program must use double buffering so that it can acquire new samples
while storing old samples. To do this you will use the TMR0 ISR to
collected converted values from the ADC and start a new conversion.
In addition, the TMR0
ISR is responsible for moving the sampled value into either the red
or blue buffer (both global variables because of their size), and set
flags true to indicate when either buffer is full. Main should be
monitoring these flags and writing the red or blue buffer to the SD
Card when either is full. While main is doing this, the ISR should be
storing microphone samples to the other buffer.
<br><Br>

You should record "This is a test, one, two, three, four". Then
spool the audio message the 's' function. Then plot this waveform
using the Excel Instructions below.
<br><br>

Consider trying our
<a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~jfalkinburg/husker-scope/app/page/FunctionGenerator">Husker Scope</a>
to record clean audio waveforms with predictable shapes.


<li><b>s</b><br>
In computing the term spooling is generally taken to mean outputting
a lot of raw data. I want you to provide the capability to spool blocks
of the SD Card to the terminal. Before you start
spooling, you will configure PuTTY to store anything that appears on
the terminal into a file. You will then spool blocks of the SD CArd
to the terminal. Finally you will instruct PuTTY to close
the file. You will then open the file in Excel and plot the audio
data. I have found spooling to be slow, it may be worth increasing the
Baud rate for this assignment - if you do, don't forget to configure
PuTTy to the same Baud rate.
<br><br>

When the user presses "s", provide them with the following prompt:
<pre>
You may terminate spooling at anytime with a keypress.
To spool terminal contents into a file follow these instructions:

Right mouse click on the upper left of the PuTTY window
Select:     Change settings...
Select:     Logging
Select:     Session logging: All session output
Log file name:  Browse and provide a .csv extension to your file name
Select:     Apply
Press any key to start
</pre>

Your program should then read consecutive blocks of the SD Card and
print the ADC values, one per row, out to the terminal. After
each block is printed to the terminal, check if a key has been pressed,
if not continue to read that block,  print all 512-bytes and then check
again for a keypress. You can check for a keypress using the
<font face="courier">EUSART1_DataReady function</font> - you should clear
the associated flag
using a void EUSART1 read using a statement like:
<font face="courier">(void) EUSART1_Read();</font>
<br><br>

Continue until a key is pressed or the last
byte of the last block has been printed to the terminal. At this
point you should present the user with some instructions to close
the log file. They should look something like:
<pre>
117
116
115
116
115
117
115
115
115
117
113
112
112
112
113
Spooled 512 out of the 512 blocks.
To close the file follow these instructions:

Right mouse click on the upper left of the PuTTY window
Select:     Change settings...
Select:     Logging
Select:     Session  logging: None
Select:     Apply
</pre>

</ul>

<h3>Excel Instructions</h3>
In order to plot the spooled data, follow these instructions.
<ul>	<li>Open putty.csv in excel,
	<li>Delete any non-data lines at the top of column A by
	selecting the row numbers, right mouse and select delete,
	<li>Go to the bottom of the A column by clicking on any
	cell in the A column and then pressing the "End" key
	and then pressing the down-arrow key,
	<li>Delete any non-data rows at the bottom of column A,
	<li>Go back to the top of column A by clicking on any
	cell in column A and the pressing the "End" key and then
	pressing the up-arrow key,
	<li>Select column A by clicking on the A,
	<li>Add a X-Y scatter plot Insert &rarr; Charts &rarr; X-Y scatter
	&rarr; Scatter with Straight Lines,
	<li>Change the title of the plot with that you said, by clicking
	on "title" and typing,
	<li>Stretch the graph horizontally by grabbing the right edge
	and mousing right.
</ul>
You should have something that looks like the following.
