<h2>InLab 3</h2>
Some self-guided <a href="./inlab03.html">activities</a>.


<h2>Lab 3 assignment</h2>
You may work in teams of one or two.

<h2>Lab assignment</h2>
Build an embedded system which plays a song every time the upper button is
pressed.
<br><Br>

<b>Note</b>
If you have an existing configuration (say from the inlab03) that you want to
copy over to a new project (say for your lab03), then:
<ul>	<li>Copy the xxx.mc3 file (from your inlab03) into the main
	directory of the new project (lab03),
	<li>In the project manager area of the new project (lab03) add the
	xxx.mc3 file into the Important Files folder (in the project navigator
	window) by right clicking and selecting "Add Item to Important Files...",
	<li>Open the Microchips code configurator,
	<li>The inlab03 configuration will load,
	<li>Edit the (inlab03) configuration as needed,
	<li>Generate the MCC support files.
</ul>

<b>Program Requirements</b>
<li>A whole note should take 1 second, half note 0.5 seconds, and so on,
<li>Have a 32<sup>nd</sup> rest between notes,
<li>Use Timer 1 with a 1:1: prescaler to generate the note frequencies,
<li>Store at least two octaves worth of notes (half periods of timer 1)
	in an array called <font face="courier">scale</font>. For example,
	my code has the following (partial) declaration:<br>
<font face="courier">uint16_t scale[NUM_OCTAVES*12] = {12864,12144,11472,10816,10208,9632,&hellip;</font><br>
	Note, I used a #define to set NUM_OCTAVES to 2,
<li>Use Timer 0 with a 1:256 prescaler to generate the note durations,
<li>Store your song in two arrays, one for notes and one for duration,
<ul>	<li>The array storing the notes of the song should have the index
	of the scale of each note. For example, my code which plays Hot
	Crossed Buns, has the following (partial) declaration:<br>
<font face="courier">uint16_t notes[SONG_LENGTH] = {B5, A5, G4, B5, A5,&hellip;</font><br>
	The symbols in the notes array "B5", "A5", etc. are #defined
	to indicies in the scale
	array which contains the half period of that note. For example,
	since the half period of a G4 note is 10208 timer 1 counts (which
	is index 4 in the scale array defined above), my code contains the
	following #define at the top of the program:<Br>
	<font face="courier">#define G4      4</font><br>
	<li>The array storing the duration of the notes of the song,  For
	example my code has the following (partial) declaration:<br>
<font face="courier">uint16_t    duration[SONG_LENGTH] = {QUA, QUA, HAL, QUA,&hellip;</font><br>
	The symbols in the duration array, "QUA", "HAL" are #define to
	the number of 1:256
	prescaled timer 0 counts each duration required. For example, a quarter
	note is 0.25 seconds long, corresponding to 15625 counts on a 1:256
	prescaled timer 0. So my code contains the following define:<br>
	<font face="courier">#define QUA     15625</font>
	</ul>
	<li>Set the speaker pin to logic 0 when you are not playing a note,
	<li>Use the MCC functions to:
	<ul>	<li>write the timers,
		<li>check if the timer has overflowed,
		<li>read the button, and
		<li>toggle speaker pin.
	</ul>
	Do not use the TMR1_CounterGet or TMR0_CounterGet functions.
</ul>


<br><br>
<b>Verification:</b><br>
Play the notes of a song with at least 12 notes and that includes
at least 2 different note durations.

<h2>Turn-in</h2>
You may work with a single partner (or alone) to complete this lab.
Submit your main.c file on Canvas using the instructions posted
there. You should take note of the Rubric that will be used to evaluate
your assignment. Please form a group before submitting using the
instructions posted on Canvas. You will demonstrate your code at the
beginning of lab.
