<h1>Mplab and XC8 Install on Linux</h1>
</center>


<h2>Mplab on Linux</h2>
One of the reasons that I chose to use the MPLab X IDE is that it is
available as a free download allowing student to use it on their own 
computers.  This supports an important
pillar of my teaching philosophy; to enable students to work 
independently to explore and solve interesting problems.  Unfortunately,
many engineering programs are PC only, leaving Linux users with awkward
solutions to work off campus.  Fortunately with a little work, Linux users
can install and use the MPLAB X IDE + XC8.  What follows are some guidelines
to help you through the process.
<br><br>

As a PC user I have not tested these!  I would, however, be more than 
happy to improve the quality.  Just send me 
an email at coulston@mines.edu with concrete suggestions on how to improve 
them.  Support your fellow and future Linux users.  That said, thanks to 
Connor for providing these.
<br><br>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
Make sure you have the following packages installed
<ul>
<li>tar
<li>bash
</ul>
You should also have the permissions to run files as root.

These instillation instructions for MPLAB and XC8 were used to install the
software on a Fedora Linux system using the KDE Plasma Desktop environment.
Download the Linux version of MPLAB X IDE from the following link:
<a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide#tabs">
	https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide#tabs</a>
<br><br>

Then you need to extract the archive file, which can be done with the
following command:
<pre>
  $ tar -xvf MPLABX-v*-linux-installer.tar
</pre>
This uses a wildcard to ignore the version of MPLAB you are using.
You will then need to run the installer as root (using sudo as necessary):
<pre>
  # ./MPLABX-v*-linux-installer.sh
</pre>
